<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
THE NEW SCHOOL-MISTRESS.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "The trivial round, the common task,<br>
  Would furnish all we ought to ask&mdash;<br>
  Room to deny ourselves, a road<br>
  To bring us daily nearer God."&mdash;<i>Keble.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"In a month from this time you will enter on
your new duties as mistress of the Hepshaw girls'
school."
</p>

<p>
Queenie gave a little start and cry of suppressed
pleasure, and then the color rushed over
her face.  With sudden impulse, as involuntary
as it was graceful, she held out her hand to
Garth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Clayton! how kind you are to me!
Once or twice I was half afraid you had
forgotten; and all the time you were quietly
arranging it."
</p>

<p>
Garth was quite equal to the occasion.  He
looked down at the girl's radiant face, so
expressive of joy and gratitude, with warm
kindliness shining in his eyes.  When the slim hand
was stretched out to him he held it for a
moment as though it had been Cathy's.  "Oh, if he
were only my brother!" sighed the girl to herself,
with a little outburst of natural yearning as
she felt the strong clasp.
</p>

<p>
Garth's handsome face looked almost as bright
as hers.  His position contented him; it was
novel as well as interesting.  It pleased him to
throw the shield of his protection and tenderness
round these young strangers, who had, in a way,
appealed to his generosity.  If Queenie had been
old and plain he would have been just as gentle
and chivalrous in his manner to her.  No woman
would ever have had a rough word from Garth;
but a little of the zest and flavor would have
been wanting.
</p>

<p>
To read gratitude in a pair of wonderful brown
eyes, that seem to have no bottom to their
depth, and to feel a soft, girlish hand touch his
own timidly, were new revelations to the young
man, who was a philosopher, but no stoic.  He
remembered their expression long afterwards, and
the peculiar feel of the fluttering fingers, with an
odd sensation that tingled through him.  "What
a contrast she is to Dora!" he thought again.
</p>

<p>
"You are very, very good to me," continued
Queenie; but he interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't deserve half these thanks; I have
done very little, after all.  So you thought I had
forgotten you?  When you know me better,"
went on Garth with good-humored reproach,
"you will find out that I am a man of my word.
When I say I will do a thing you may be sure
that if it be in my power it will be done."
</p>

<p>
"I was not so unjust as to doubt you,"
returned Queenie, humbly, "only as the days
went on I lost hope.  I thought you had failed
in persuading Mr. Logan, and did not like to
tell me."
</p>

<p>
"I hope I never shrink from any duty, however
unpleasant; procrastination is only for
cowards.  I should certainly have told you at once,
Miss Marriott.  But now for these miserable
details," continued Garth, changing his grave tone
into a lighter one.  "So you will persist in thinking
it a matter of congratulation that you are to
be our future school-mistress?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."
</p>

<p>
"It is not a very desirable post; indeed, it
is quite beneath your acceptance.  You cannot
think how strongly Mr. Logan and I feel on that
point.  As the Vicar's churchwarden I had a
right to take my own ground in the matter, and
we have arranged that your future stipend shall
be fifty pounds a-year.  More than this is out of
our power," continued Garth, stammering a little,
and for the first time becoming slightly
embarrassed.  "There is not even a dwelling-house or
lodging attached to the salary; but the Vicar
wishes, that is&mdash;" corrected Garth, feeling
himself on the edge of a very decided fib, and
slightly daunted by the look in Queenie's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You are not going to offer me more than my
fair salary?" returned the girl, drawing up her
head with a sudden gesture of pride he had never
seen in her before, and her voice sounded clear
and decided.  "You told Mr. Logan, of course,
that this was impossible?  I will work; but I
will not be beholden to him or any other man
for a penny more than I have honestly earned.
Forty, not fifty, pounds was the sum you named
to me in the quarry."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be contumacious, Miss Marriott,"
returned Garth, with an amused look; but on the
whole he rather liked the girl's independence
than otherwise; it accorded with his own
notions.  He had held these sentiments all his life,
and it was his chief pride that he had never
been beholden to his fellows for anything that he
could not justly claim.  "Pride, independence,
were necessary adjuncts to manhood," so Garth
thought; "but in a woman, perhaps, they might
be made to yield under the pressure of emergency."
</p>

<p>
"I will only take what belongs to me," she
continued obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"Then that will be fifty pounds a-year.  Listen
to me, please," as she again attempted to speak.
"I am the Vicar's warden, and have a right to
use my authority in this affair.  I have always
considered that our mistresses are underpaid; I
intend to fix the salary from this time at the
sum I named.  Mr. Logan and Captain Fawcett,
our remaining trustee, agree to this; so," finished
Garth, with a persuasive smile, "it is signed,
sealed, and delivered, and only wants your
consent."
</p>

<p>
Queenie bowed her head gravely, and with a
little dignity.  She was sharp-witted enough to
see that Garth had not said all he intended, that
something perilous to her pride lay folded on the
edge of that fib; something that, with the kindest
intentions in the world, would have wounded
her susceptibility and hurt her.
</p>

<p>
"Then there is nothing more to say?" rather
stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"Do these details weary you!  They are very
necessary," he returned, with a frank kindness
that disarmed her at once.  "If you fill this
position it is better to understand everything
thoroughly.  You still think that, with the little
you have, and the chance of giving lessons in
the evening, you will be able to live upon
the proceeds of so small a salary?  There is your
little sister remember, Miss Marriott."
</p>

<p>
"We have learned to do without things, and
to be content with very little; it will be enough,
thank you," returned the girl, quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Then in that case I can only wish you success
on your undertaking.  Your duties will not
be so very arduous.  The hours are from nine to
twelve in the morning, and from two to four in
the afternoon.  The school-house is a miserable
sort of place, a compromise between a barn and
a small dissenting chapel.  You are not so
fortunate as Mr. Miles; the boys' school-house is a
much handsomer and more commodious building."
</p>

<p>
"I have seen him, have I not?" asked
Queenie, somewhat curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, but it is holiday time, and he always
goes down to his brother in Wales.  He is a very
pleasant sort of fellow, though rather an oddity;
is slightly lame, plays on the violin, and is an
inveterate smoker.  He is a man of good education,
and has been usher in two or three first-class
schools.  He had fair hopes of rising in the
world until he met with his accident.  For the
misanthrope he professes to be he is one of the
cheeriest sort possible.  He lodges over the
postoffice; Mrs. Dawes thinks a great deal of him."
</p>

<p>
"Have you no doctor here?" inquired Queenie,
with a sudden remembrance of Miss Charity.
</p>

<p>
Garth shook his head gravely.  "Ah! poor
Dr. Morgan is dead; he died the week before
you came.  He is a loss to us all, poor old
fellow!  He lived in the corner house, next
Mrs. Morris; and," with a smile breaking round the
corners of his mouth, "remained a bachelor all
his life in spite of her.  But a truce to this sort
of gossip; that would just suit Cathy.  I have
spoken to Captain Fawcett about letting Briarwood
Cottage to you, and he is perfectly willing
to do so.  The rent is fifteen pounds a-year;
but, as he justly says, it is quite unfit for human
habitation at the present&mdash;the floors want mending,
and there is some papering and whitewashing
to be done."
</p>

<p>
"The cottage is really to be mine?" she
exclaimed breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"It is yours from this present moment if you
like, though you will not enter into legal
possession for six weeks.  You must put up with our
society for that time.  I shall take the liberty of
sending Nathan over to trim the grass and weeds,
unless you are particularly partial to docks, Miss
Marriott."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, you are very good; but," hesitating,
and looking up in his face in some perplexity,
"I shall have to go over to Carlisle,
I must speak to Mr. Runciman, about the
furniture, you know; we shall want very little,
Emmie and I, at least, only a few chairs and a
table.  Do you think ten pounds will go far? one
must buy a few things, but I am so ignorant of
prices," cried poor Queenie, feeling all at once
very helpless and womanish, and hoping that he
would not laugh at her ignorance.
</p>

<p>
Garth could not help feeling amused at the
girl's <i>naïveté</i>, but he was quite ready for the
emergency, having already settled it all with
Langley.  "If she be very independent we can
manage it best in this way," he had said to his
sister.
</p>

<p>
"One must have chairs and tables; well, and a
few other things.  There must be blankets for
winter, and cooking utensils," continued Garth,
with charming frankness.  "Langley knows better
than I about such matters, and by-and-bye we
will get her to draw up a list.  Langley has a
splendid head for details.  There is a second-hand
lot of things going off in a few days'
time; you can leave Langley and me to manage it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but the money; there will only be about
ten or twelve pounds that Miss Titheridge sent
me back at the last.  She said she owed it to us,
but it was only her conscience that pricked her,
I know."
</p>

<p>
"You must keep that for present expenses, as
you cannot draw your salary beforehand," he
returned promptly.  "I will tell you what we
will do: Langley shall invest in these few
articles for you,&mdash;we shall pick them up cheaply,
you know,&mdash;and you shall repay her by instalments,
just a small sum quarterly as you can
spare it.  Langley shall have a regular debtor
and creditor account.  Nothing need offend your
independence, Miss Marriott."
</p>

<p>
"No; but it is too kind, much, much too
kind," she returned, hesitating.  "And how do I
know when I may be able to repay it?"
</p>

<p>
"In two years' time at the farthest," he
returned cheerfully.  "I only look upon it as a
safe investment for Langley's money."
</p>

<p>
"Owe no man anything, but to love one
another," suddenly came into Queenie's mind.
Was she fastening a load of debt round her
neck? would she ever be able to pay it back? was not
this another kindly ruse to afford her help?
</p>

<p>
She looked up quickly, almost suspiciously,
but the grey eyes that watched her were honest
and straightforward.  He would not press
benefits on her that he felt would be repugnant.
No; she was sure of that.
</p>

<p>
Garth answered her unspoken thought, flushing
slightly, as though her mute appeal touched
him.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you will be able to repay us; we
will do all in our power to help you to do
so."  Then, after a moment's hesitation: "I feel just
as you do about these sort of things.  I like
to help myself, and not to be dependent on
other people.  Believe me, Miss Marriott, I
think far too highly of your independence, and
respect you too much to offer you any help
that you could not accept."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will trust you," returned Queenie in
a low tone.  She spoke upon impulse.  It cost her
a momentary pang, as though she felt some cold
weight suddenly settling down on her; and after
all, what could she do?  Caleb could not help
them, at least not much.  Emmie and she
could not dwell between four bare walls.  What
was there for her but to accept the kindly
advance so gracefully hidden under Langley's
name&mdash;Langley and Cathy, who had not a six-pence
of their own, as Cathy once somewhat
triumphantly informed her?  "It is Garth who
buys everything for us, dear old fellow, and pays
all our bills, after grumbling over them," she said
once.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you, you will never repent the trust,"
he answered, so gravely that Queenie feared he
was hurt by her reluctance, until the old bright
smile came back to re-assure her.  "Then this
grand matter is settled, and we will go and talk
to Langley."
</p>

<p>
Emmie was almost wild with joy when she
heard the news.  The sensitive little creature burst
into a perfect passion of tears, as she clung to her
sister's neck, trembling with such excitement
that Queenie was frightened.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queenie, is it really, really true that we
are going to live in that little cottage, you and
I together, like the sisters in story books?" she
exclaimed over and over again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; once upon a time there were two
sisters&mdash;one of them was handsome and the other
ugly," interrupted Cathy briskly.
</p>

<p>
"The handsome one was my Queen then, she
drops diamonds and roses every time she speaks;
I am the little ugly duckling they called me at
Miss Titheridge's."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," returned Cathy abruptly, kissing
the little pale face, as she spoke somewhat
hurriedly.  There was still a weird, unchildlike look
about Emmie&mdash;the blue eyes were still too bright
and large, the cheeks too thin and hollow, but the
little rings of yellow hair were beginning to curl
prettily over the temples.  "Remember the ugly
duckling turned into the beautiful swan at last."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't want beauty; Queenie is welcome
to it all.  I shall have it some day in heaven,
there is no ugliness there you know," moralized
the child in her strange old-fashioned way.  A
sudden mist rose to her sister's eyes as she spoke,
the graceful fancies of the old fairy tale dissolved,
and in its place came an overwhelming vision of
a white-robed multitude, beatific with youth,
and endowed with angelic beauty.
</p>

<p>
There is no ugliness there; no, little Emmie,
no ugliness because no sin, no weariness of a
diseased and worn-out body, no gloom of an
over-tempted and troubled mind; for in the new
heavens and the new earth God will see that
everything there also is good.
</p>

<p>
They were sitting together on the low window-seat
of the room that the sisters occupied; and
Cathy had come in, with her long black hair
floating over her shoulders, to chat over her
friend's new prospect.  It was one of those quiet,
calm summer nights, when a "peace be still"
seems whispered to God's universe; a white
crescent moon hung in the dark blue sky, bright
facets of gold glimmered here and there, the
dark sycamores hardly stirred in the faint breeze,
the tombstones shone in the pure white light;
below them the church stood in dark shadow.
</p>

<p>
"I like this better than our old garret,"
whispered Emmie.  "I am so fond of that
churchyard, Cathy; I like it better than
Mrs. Fawcett's garden.  I like to lie in bed and think
of the real people who are buried there, and
wonder what they were like when they walked
and talked as we are doing.  The world seems
so full of dead and living people somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Talking of churchyards always makes me
shiver," returned Cathy, exchanging a meaning
glance with her friend.  Emmie was not always
quite canny, she thought.  "I would rather
talk about Queenie's new cottage, and all the
fun we mean to have there.  I shall come to
tea nearly every night, and in the winter you
and I will toast muffins, Emmie, and roast
chestnuts.  I think I must give you one of my
Persian kittens, since you have left yours at
Carlisle; no cottage is complete without a cat on
the hearth."
</p>

<p>
"But, Cathy," remonstrated her friend, "I am
afraid there will be little time for fun of any
sort.  There will be French lessons to give on two
or three evenings in the week; and by-and-bye
there will be Emmie to teach, and our clothes to
mend, and then, as we can only afford a girl to
clean up and do the rough work, I shall have
to teach myself cooking.  And, oh dear, the day
will never be long enough for all I shall have to
do," sighed poor Queenie, all at once oppressed
by a sense of her future work.
</p>

<p>
"Do you suppose that I shall sit down with
folded hands and see you slave yourself to death
in that fashion?" returned Cathy in an aggrieved
voice, "is that your notion of friendship, you
disagreeable old Queen?  You will have teaching
enough with the village children and Mrs. Morris's
seven little hopes; you may make up
your mind just to leave Emmie to me."
</p>

<p>
"But that is nonsense.  What would Langley
say to such a proposal?"
</p>

<p>
"Langley is charmed at the notion; we settled
it between us this morning.  Emmie is to come
and do her lessons with me every morning, and
her music with Langley.  I shall make a first-rate
governess, my dear Madam Dignity; and,"
mimicking Langley's soft serious voice, "think
what a grand thing it will be not to let my
acquirements rust, but to turn them to solid
account!"  Then with a burst of her old vivacity,
"think what a blessing you and Emmie will be
to me! you will give me occupation, and prevent
my dying of ennui in this mill-pond of existence,
as Ted calls it."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's eyes looked unutterable things, but
she only said, "Oh Cathy, Cathy, how can I ever
repay all your goodness?"
</p>

<p>
"Goodness to myself, you mean.  I will tell
you what we will do, Queen: we will coax
Langley to let us go into the kitchen and take
regular lessons from Susan; it will be rather hot
work this weather, but we will go through the
furnace of affliction together.  You are beginning
house-keeping on rather a small scale, my poor
dear; but to live we must eat, and to eat I fear
we require a certain amount of ingredients,
concerning the price and the cooking of which I fear
we are profoundly ignorant."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," returned her friend ruefully,
"This must be rectified at once.  What a
blessing you are to me.  I was sighing for
new worlds to conquer, and now frying-pans
and mending open a new scope for
my feminine talents.  How I used to envy
those Israelitish women when I was at
school."
</p>

<p>
"You used to be very cross on darning
afternoons," put in Emmie.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I was.  Think of one's clothes
never wearing out for forty years! it was enough
to reconcile them to the wilderness.  I should
not be surprised if I rather liked it now.
Suppose we take lessons in patching from Miss
Faith?"
</p>

<p>
"I must help too," broke in the child eagerly.
"I can mend quite neatly now, Cathy; and I
will weed the garden, and grow radishes, and
mustard, and cress, and sweep up the hearth,
and put on the kettle for Queenie when she
comes home tired.  Oh I wish Caleb and Molly
would come and live with us, and that we could
all be happy together."
</p>

<p>
"Caleb would not like to leave Carlisle, or
Molly either; you must be content with me,
and only me."
</p>

<p>
"My dears," interrupted Langley's quiet voice
from the door, "it is past eleven, and these
night dews are not wholesome for the child; let
me beg you to close the window, and leave off
talking;" and thus admonished, the little party
broke up somewhat hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
Queenie had interviews with Mr. Logan and
Captain Fawcett the next day.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Miss Marriott, so you are to be my
tenant for Briarwood cottage," he said, stopping
to speak to her, as they encountered each other
in the lane.  "My wife was so glad to get the
little lassie for a neighbor, that you might
almost have made your own terms with us."
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind not to put difficulties in
my way.  The rent is so small that I thought we
could afford it.  It will be quieter than lodgings,
and more to ourselves; but it sounds rather
ambitious, a home of our own," returned the
girl, with a little thrill of excitement.  Poor as
it was it would be home.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose we go and have a look at it,"
proposed Captain Fawcett in his curt, business-like
way.  "It is in miserable need of repairs, I
know; that last tenant of mine let it go to rack
and ruin.  I will go over to Hargrave's and get
the key.  Oh, there's the Vicar crossing over to
speak to you; I can safely leave him with you a
minute."
</p>

<p>
"I must shake hands with my new
school-mistress," said Mr. Logan, beaming on her
through his spectacles.  "So you have talked us
all over, and got your own way; well, well,
everything is for the best, of course; but to have a
young lady, a clergyman's daughter too, teaching
in that crazy little building yonder is a strange
sight to me."
</p>

<p>
"I shall not be above my work; you will have
no reason to repent your decision," returned the
girl firmly, but modestly.
</p>

<p>
"Well said, my dear young lady, 'who sweeps
a room.'  You know what our excellent Herbert
says, 'It is the motive that ennobles the
work.'  I am glad to see you remember that."
</p>

<p>
"I mean my work to ennoble me," replied
Queenie, her face glowing with the thought.  "It
does not matter that the building is poor, and
the children some of them rough and uncultivated;
it is a grand work to teach young minds,
and to watch their progress, and get interested
in their lives.  It may tire one a little at times,"
she continued candidly, "but it is not mere
drudgery and nothing else.  Oh, Mr. Logan, say
you are pleased to have me; it will give me
heart and courage to hear you say so."
</p>

<p>
"Pleased!  I am more glad than I can say,"
returned the Vicar, with a look that Queenie did
not quite read, but which touched her greatly, it
was at once so keen and gentle.  "God bless
both the work and worker.  Oh, here comes the
Captain; perhaps when you have looked over
your new abode you may like to see the inside
of the school-house?"
</p>

<p>
"We will all walk down together," interposed
the Captain.  "Come along, Miss Marriott; don't
keep the Vicar waiting."
</p>

<p>
Queenie followed the two gentlemen silently.
A strange sensation woke in her as she crossed
the threshold.  She had closed the first chapter of
her existence.  Here was a new life waiting for
her to take up; it would be lived out underneath
this humble roof.  The past lay shrouded away,
hidden like a dead hand out of sight.  What
would the future hold for her and Emmie?
</p>

<p>
She followed them silently from room to room,
as Captain Fawcett made his brief, business-like
comments.  The damp oozed from the corners,
long lengths of soiled paper trailed from the
walls, the boards creaked under their foot-fall,
the scurry of tiny feet and the squeak of mice
sounded behind the wainscot, docks and nettles
peeped in at the begrimed windows.  Queenie
shivered slightly.
</p>

<p>
"We will alter all this," exclaimed Captain
Fawcett, turning briskly round on her, and
pulling at his grey moustache.  "This damp
mouldiness is enough to make any one shiver; a little
paint and a few coats of white-wash, and a fresh
paper or two, will make a different thing of it."
</p>

<p>
"I was not thinking of the damp," returned
Queenie in a low voice; and then she went and
stood by herself at the window, looking up the
ridge of ragged grass that lay like a steep little
wilderness behind the house.  It was the newness
and the strangeness of her surroundings that
oppressed her.  "To have a house of one's
own, that is the strangest part of all," she
thought.
</p>

<p>
She was still silent as she walked down the
village street.  One or two of the women at the
cottage doors stood and looked after them
curiously; but at the sight of the quaint edifice,
with its half-moon windows, Queenie's youthful
energy revived.
</p>

<p>
She walked in, head erect, as the gentlemen
made way for her, and stood before the old
wooden desks, and looked at the half-dozen
forms before her.  It was a small square room,
well, but not cheerfully, lighted; the windows
set so high in the walls that no signs of the
outer world could distract the attention of the
little students.
</p>

<p>
"This small inner room is for the infants,"
explained Mr. Logan, coming round to her side;
"it is a very humble affair, you see."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but it is my work," returned Queenie,
facing round on them with a quiver of
excitement.  "My work, and my life, and no other's,
and I mean to do the best with both of them that
I can."
</p>

<p>
Some one stooping his high head at the
door cried softly "Amen" to himself.
</p>

<p>
It was Garth Clayton.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The next week or two passed pleasantly and
quickly.  The girls adhered rigidly to their
course of self-improvement, despite the
temptation afforded by summer days.  During the
fresh morning hours they remained closely shut
up in kitchen or pantry, busied in all sorts of
mysteries connected with the culinary art,
appearing at the early dinner with flushed tired
faces and slightly dishevelled hair.  All sorts of
telegraphic communications passed between them
and Langley.  Garth, who was not in the secret,
and who was a somewhat fastidious as well
as abstemious man, was a little perplexed by
Susan's vagaries, as he termed them.
</p>

<p>
"What has come to the woman, Langley?" he
would say.  "She has always been the best bread-maker
in Hepshaw, but this last batch is almost
uneatable, it is so heavy and sad.  Her pies last
night were disgraceful, and now this joint is
under-done."
</p>

<p>
"I will speak to her," Langley would answer,
quietly, while the girls interchanged looks of
confusion and dismay.  Queenie's discomfiture
and disappointment were too obvious one day
to escape notice.  Garth, who was really annoyed,
and had been complaining in no very measured
terms, caught sight of the girl's crimsoned face,
and at once held his peace.  But the next day
he marched into the kitchen, and found Susan
and her coadjutors at work.
</p>

<p>
It was really a picturesque sight.  The girls
had rolled up their sleeves in imitation of Susan,
and the round dimpled arms were very white
and pretty; the coarse bib-aprons could not
disguise the slim figures.  Cathy had tied a
handkerchief over her dark hair; she looked like
a young Zingara as she walked across the
kitchen, flourishing her basting-ladle; she was
stirring some savory mess in a great iron pot.
"Far over hill and dale freely we roam," sang
Cathy.  "Queen, I am sure this will be a success,
it smells so good."
</p>

<p>
"Hush! here comes your brother," ejaculated
Queenie.  The smooth rolling-pin slipped out of
her hand; the sunshine streamed through the
window on the red brick floor, and the white
table heaped up with ripe fruit, with great golden
plums and clusters of red cherries.  One level
beam had touched the girl's brown hair with gold;
her coarse apron enveloped her.  She looked like
Cinderella before her pumpkin chariot arrived.
</p>

<p>
"So I have two new cooks, have I?" laughed
Garth, as he lounged against the doorway.  What
a pretty picture it was&mdash;the low dark kitchen
never looked so inviting before.  He made Cathy
bring him some cider, and then helped himself
to some of Queenie's fruit.  Queenie picked him
out the juiciest plums with her long white
fingers; they had quite a little feast together,
the girls waiting on him.  Before he went away
Queenie had finished rolling out her dough; the
tarts were all in the oven before Susan's testy
hints were taken, and she had her kitchen to
herself.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoons they sat over their work
with Langley in some shady corner of the
garden.  Sometimes, but not often, Miss Faith
joined them.
</p>

<p>
"Cara does not want me, and so I have come
up for an hour," she would say.  Her quiet eyes
would brighten, and a tinge of color would come
into her face, at the sight of the little party
gathered on the lawn.  Sometimes Garth would
be there, stretched on the crisp short grass at
Langley's feet, with his paper or his book beside
him.  He always started up, well-pleased, at the
sight of his favorite.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Charity cannot always have you; other
people want you too," he would say, as he
brought out another low basket-work chair, and
gathered her a rose or two, for Miss Faith had a
passion for flowers.  Garth dealt in these chivalrous
little attentions; it pleased him to tender
these sort of offerings to the women he delighted
to honor.  "You are my patron saint," he would
say to her, as he laid the flowers beside her.
"Faith is very necessary to us all, but you
never seem to remember that," with almost an
affectionate intonation in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"I am only necessary to Cara," she would
answer sadly.  She took Garth's little speeches,
his flowers, his kind looks, as simply as they
were offered.  To the quiet woman of thirty-five,
who had no life of her own to live, and who had
laid her own shadowy hopes, her unspoken
desires, on the shrine of stern duty, there was
nothing suspicious or incongruous in Garth's
devotion; he liked her, and she was fond of
him.  Any other thought would have been
impossible to either of them.
</p>

<p>
Cathy once hinted at this.
</p>

<p>
"Garth cares for Miss Faith more than for
any other woman; he always has," she said once
to Queenie.  "I used to wonder, long ago,
whether anything else would ever come of it.
Men do care for women who are older than
themselves sometimes, and though she was
never pretty she has such a dear face; but I
see now that such a thought would never occur
to either of them."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," interrupted her friend,
indignantly.  "Miss Faith is very nice, but she is old
for her age.  You see, youth has been crushed
out of her.  She would make a nice Sister of
Charity; the dress would just suit her.  I like
her pale creamy complexion; but she is far, far
too old for your brother," finished Queenie, to
whom the idea was somehow repugnant.  Miss
Faith, with her soft plaintive voice and little close
bonnet, beside the strong vigorous man, still in
the glory of his youth!  Queenie's ideas were
very vague on the subject, but she thought the
woman that Garth Clayton honored with his
preference ought to be very nice indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Are you nearly through D'Aubigné's 'Reformation,'
Miss Faith?" Cathy would ask her, a
little wickedly, on these occasions.  Miss Faith
would answer her quite seriously; she did not
perfectly comprehend a joke.  Poor woman, the
little pleasantries of life, the fun and drollery of
young wits, were almost unknown to her.
</p>

<p>
"We are still in the third volume," she would
sigh; "it is hard reading for summer days, but it
suits Cara.  Hope quite enjoys it too, but it is a
treat to sit out here and listen to the birds, and
do nothing but work and talk.  I think I almost
dislike books, though I should not like Cara to
hear me; but then I never was clever."
</p>

<p>
"I think you would like the interesting sort,"
returned Langley simply.  "Do you remember
how much you cared for the volume of Jean
Ingelow's poems that I lent you? you told me
you cried over the 'Song of Seven.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, I love poetry," brightening visibly;
"but I could not make Cara interested in it in
the least; she calls it moonshine and milk and
water."
</p>

<p>
"That comes of having a strong-minded
woman for a sister," interrupted Cathy, who
never liked to be long silent.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, Cara is very strong-minded; she is
always talking about my having no mental
backbone.  She says if we do not exercise our mind,
drill it thoroughly, and put it through a course
of mental calisthenics, that we shall never keep
it in a healthy condition.  She thinks it a waste
of time to read novels, unless they are Sir Walter
Scott's or Miss Austin's.  I know it is very
bad taste, but I never could admire Miss
Austin."
</p>

<p>
"But you enjoyed 'Dombey and Son,'" interposed
Garth, who abhorred strong-minded women,
and could not tolerate Miss Charity; hearing
her opinions quoted even upset his equanimity.
"Never mind what Cara likes; we are each
bound to have our own individual taste.  If
Langley likes pickles better than strawberry
jam she has no right to prevent Cathy from
feasting on the latter dainty.  I hate rules
and regulations for grown-up people; it is just
as though we want to bring back the swaddling
clothes of infancy."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid I am not fond of rules, and I
do like poetry and novels," returned Miss Faith
timidly.  Here amongst these young people she
felt a different creature; their ideas were as fresh
and sweet to her as Garth's roses that she had
fastened in her belt.  "I must go now; but you
have done me so much good, you always do," she
said presently as she rose.  Garth pleaded hard
that she would stay, but she only shook her
head at him wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't tempt me; Cara would be disappointed
when she woke up from her afternoon
nap if she found I had not returned; it is not
nice to disappoint people, and then her pain
might come on again."
</p>

<p>
"At least you might promise to drive over
with us to Crossgill to-morrow; we are going to
introduce Miss Marriott to the Cunninghams.
Langley cannot go, and there will be a spare
place in the waggonette."  But Miss Faith would
not promise.  Two afternoons of pleasure would
be unheard-of dissipation; she would never hear
the last of it; and what would Cara do without
her reading?
</p>

<p>
"As though we cared about that," muttered
Garth, <i>sotto voce</i>; and then, as he returned from
unlatching the little side gate, he paused a
moment by Queenie.  "There goes one of life's
unsolved enigmas&mdash;a good woman thrown away
on a selfish one.  I know you agree with me,
Miss Marriott; I can read it in your face."
</p>

<p>
Queenie gave him a bright, understanding
smile.  She had just finished a most artistic-looking
patch in an old frock of Emmie's, and held it
up in critical approval.  "When people are so
good they can hardly fail to be happy," she said
with slightly qualified assent.  Somehow she did
not pity Miss Faith quite so much this afternoon;
it was a little contrary of her perhaps, but then,
had she not gone away with Garth's roses in her
belt? and had he not called her his patron saint,
and hinted that she was necessary to him, to
them all?  Queenie felt that even Miss Faith's
life was not quite devoid of all sweetness when
such speeches as these were made to her.  Garth
had not sufficient vanity to guess at these
thoughts, but he seemed quite disposed to linger
by Queenie's side and argue out the matter.  He
had been quite absorbed by Miss Faith's
conversation while she remained; and now it would
be refreshing to turn to Queenie.  It did not
occur to him to pick roses for her, but he stood
beside her, and watched her deft fingers move
swiftly over her work, with a lazy sort of
pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"No one could doubt her goodness," he went
on, taking up the thread of his argument; "the
question is, is she quite right to give up her
own will so entirely to her sister?  One may be
good and self-sacrificing, and yet preserve one's
individuality."
</p>

<p>
"I think she is not quite sufficiently strong-minded."
</p>

<p>
"Don't; if you knew how I hate that word! it
is Miss Charity's war-cry.  Women do not
need to be strong-minded, they ought to be
pliant, yielding, ready to take impressions; a
woman with an inflexible will is a man in
disguise.  If Miss Charity had married&mdash;poor
thing, she might have done so once, and have
rued taking the step to her dying day&mdash;she would
have ruled her husband with a rod of iron, much
as she rules Miss Faith."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose she is fond of her," doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes; tyranny does not exclude affection,
at least among women," was the grim answer.
"Miss Charity is only forming her sister's education,
moulding her taste, in fact; she little knows
how all the maxims slide off her like the rain off
a duck's back.  Away from her sister she is a
different creature&mdash;dares to hold her own opinions,
and to own to her own modest tastes.  I call
Miss Faith, exquisitely feminine; don't you think
that is the word for her, Miss Marriott?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Queenie hesitating.  It was very
pleasant to have Garth there beside her, talking
on any subject; but she almost wished that he
would praise Miss Faith a little less.  How did
she know, Cathy might be wrong after all;
Miss Faith was only seven years his senior,
and there were so few people in Hepshaw.
Queenie was still too young to know how silent
a man generally is on the merits of a woman he
actually loves.
</p>

<p>
"I mean her to go over to Crossgill with
us to-morrow," he said presently, returning to
the charge.  "If I have to beard the lion in his
den, and Miss Charity on her couch, I intend
to have my way.  I know what I will do,
Langley shall go over there after tea, she has
great influence with the dominant cardinal
virtue.  Willing or unwilling, Miss Faith goes
with us to-morrow."  And Garth, as usual, had
his way.
</p>

<p>
It would be hard to tell whether Queenie or
Miss Faith enjoyed the drive and the lovely
scenery most.  Cathy was on the box beside her
brother, and had the reins more than once in
her hands, and only Emmie remained with them.
</p>

<p>
Miss Faith was a quiet companion, and at
first Queenie missed her friend's lively tongue;
but by-and-bye they fell into a pleasant channel
of talk, which proved so interesting that they
were both surprised when Garth told them that
they were within sight of Crossgill, and that in
another five minutes they would be at the
Vicarage.
</p>

<p>
They were descending a steep winding road as
he spoke, and in another moment they entered the
village.  Queenie always spoke of it afterwards
as one of the prettiest villages she had ever seen.
A little stream flowed down the middle of the
road, the cottages looked picturesque and in
good condition; a fine old church seemed to
tower in symbolic majesty over the whole place.
Emmie and she uttered a simultaneous cry of
admiration when they first caught sight of
Crossgill Vicarage.  It was the ideal Vicarage;
the neatly-kept gravelled paths, the exquisitely
trimmed lawn, the flower-beds masses of
variegated colors, the rare shrubs and plants, all
spoke of the owner's cultivated taste; the house
itself, with its quaint casements and low
bay-windows, was almost embosomed in creepers
and climbing roses; the porch was full of
flowers.  As the door opened they found themselves
in a little square hall, wainscoted in oak,
with an oak staircase and low gallery running
across it.
</p>

<p>
An old servant with a wrinkled face, evidently
about eighty years old, welcomed Cathy and
Garth with beaming smiles.  Garth shook hands
with her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Nurse, I have brought visitors to see
your young lady.  Oh, there is Miss Dora," as a
slight girlish figure crossed the gallery, and came
rapidly down the broad low staircase towards
them.
</p>

<p>
What a picturesque little figure it was.
Picturesque&mdash;that was just the word for her.  No one
in their senses could have called Dora Cunningham
pretty, but taken altogether she was simply
charming.
</p>

<p>
She was dressed so quaintly too; the shady
coarse straw hat, with the wreath of wild convolvoli,
just suited the pale <i>piquante</i> face; and over
her dark blue cambric she wore a long narrow
holland apron, laced across the bodice in
old-century fashion, and bordered with antique
silken flowers.  A kitten's soft head and innocent
blue eyes peeped out of one of the pockets.
"You have come at last," she said with just a
slight accent of reproach, and a little satirical
elevation of the eyebrows.  "I have been looking
for you for weeks past.  Where is Langley? and
why has not Ted been to see me lately?"
</p>

<p>
"I have brought Miss Faith and our guest,
Miss Marriott, instead," returned Garth.  "This
is her little sister Emmie.  Are you going to
give us some tea, Miss Dora?  Where is your
father?  Shall I go and look for him while you
show these ladies your pretty drawing-room and
conservatory?"
</p>

<p>
"Nurse, will you send papa to us, please.  No,
Mr. Clayton, I am not going to let you escape
like that; you owe me some apology first for
your long absence.  What have you been doing?
What have you all been doing?  Come in here;
I mean to catechise you."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cunningham spoke in a brisk, pleasant
voice, though it had a sharp, decided note or two
in it.  She marshalled her guests with perfect
ease and self-possession into the long
bay-windowed drawing-room.  A white-haired,
aristocratic-looking man in an old gardening coat
came out of the conservatory with a watering-pot
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Papa, you must come and talk to Miss
Marriott and Miss Palmer, please.  Let me take
that watering-pot away, it is trickling all over
the carpet, and your coat is covered with lime.
Do you like a low chair, Miss Marriott?  If you
sit there you can see the flowers in the conservatory,
and just a pretty peep of the garden.  I
hope you will talk to papa, he is so fond of
talking to strangers.  Miss Palmer, you know
papa, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Faith and I are old friends, my dear,"
interposed Mr. Cunningham.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know; it is Miss Marriott who is the
only stranger," returned Dora calmly, untying
her hat.  She had white dimpled hands, rather
like a baby's.  "Now, Mr. Clayton, please tell
me what you have been doing with yourself all
this time?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cunningham proved himself a most genial
host.  He took Miss Faith and Queenie into the
conservatory, and gathered some of his choicest
flowers for them.  A little summer shower had
just commenced; the light patter of drops on the
glass roof blended unceasingly with the voices.
Dora's canaries were singing loudly; a small
blue-black Skye terrier scampered over the wet lawn.
Miss Faith seemed rapt in quiet happiness;
Queenie was just a trifle absent and distracted.
</p>

<p>
Through the conservatory door she could catch
sight of a pretty group.  Dora sat in her little
low chair, and Cathy had ensconced herself on
the rug at her feet.  Garth stood with his broad
shoulders propped against the wooden mantel-piece,
looking at them both.  His face wore an
amused expression; evidently he was well
entertained.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think her pretty?" whispered
Emmie, coming round to her sister's side.  "She
is like a picture, somehow; but I like your face
best, Queenie, there is more in it."  Queenie
could not understand why the child's remark
jarred on her.  She colored hastily and turned
away.
</p>

<p>
But she told herself afterwards that Emmie
was right on one point.  Dora Cunningham was
certainly not pretty: her teeth were a little too
prominent, her nose was somewhat blunt and
unformed, and her eyes were blue and still, and
had no special depth in them.  Her fair hair
was her chief beauty; it was very abundant, and
she wore it gracefully, just simply turned off
from her face and knotted carelessly behind.
</p>

<p>
At this early stage of their acquaintance
Queenie hardly knew whether she was attracted
or repulsed by the young mistress of Crossgill
Vicarage.  Her perfect self-possession, her
absence of all consciousness, her cool, business-like
comments on things in general, her faith in
her own management and powers of observation,
astonished Queenie not a little.
</p>

<p>
From the first she had taken possession of
Garth, quite frankly and openly.
</p>

<p>
"I always leave the ladies to papa," she said
to Queenie, as she led the way by-and-bye into
the hall, where tea had been prepared for them.
"Papa is such a lady's man.  I always get on
best with gentlemen, at least if they are like
Mr. Clayton.  Girls are all very well in their
way, but men are so much more amusing.  I
dare say you think the same?"
</p>

<p>
"I have never thought about it; I have seen
so few gentlemen in my life," answered Queenie,
a little confused by the question.  The music
and drawing-masters at Granite Lodge and
Caleb Runciman were about the only specimens
of manhood with whom she had been acquainted,
until her arrival at Church-Stile House.  She
was afraid, too, that Garth had overheard Miss
Cunningham's frank speech; if he had, he took
no notice.  He placed himself at the little oval
table beside his young hostess, and looked at the
plump childish hands, busy amongst the old
china cups and saucers.
</p>

<p>
The old nurse stood behind her mistress's chair,
and joined in the conversation.  She and Garth
seemed great friends.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Nurse, how are Miss Beatrix and Miss
Florence?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, very well, bless their dear hearts.
Miss Beatrix is taller than Miss Dora even,
and is growing prettier than ever.  We want
them back, Mr. Clayton, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Nurse, that's nonsense," interposed
Dora, briskly.  "Remember they are gone for
their good, not ours.  Beatrix must finish her
education before she comes home; you know
papa and I have settled that."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think the poor young ladies like
foreign parts so well as home," sighed the old
woman, plaintively.  "Miss Flo writes beautiful
letters, to be sure; but she says she is home-sick
sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Have you sisters?" enquired Queenie, with a
little surprise.  She thought Dora was the only
inhabitant of the vicarage.
</p>

<p>
Dora nodded.  "Yes; there are the girls.
Nurse is talking about them now; she is always
talking about them.  They are at school in
Brussels.  They are very well, of course, for
girls, only I have never forgiven them for not
being boys.  I have always so longed for a
brother&mdash;a great big brother&mdash;to take me about
when papa is lazy or tired," appealing to Garth
with candid blue eyes, not unlike the kitten's.
</p>

<p>
"What a pity we can't make you a present of
Ted," returned Garth coolly; but Nurse
interposed again with the garrulity of age.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Dora, dear, I can't bear to hear you
talk so; it doesn't seem right, does it, sir? with
those sweet young ladies for sisters, adoring her
and spoiling her as they do.  Why one of these
days, my darling, you will have a husband to
take you about; that will be better than a
brother, won't it, Mr. Clayton, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I shall have a husband some day,
but there is no need for you to drag him in
before-hand, Nurse;" returned Dora with perfect
composure, as she tied on her broad-brimmed
hat again.  The allusion in Garth's presence did
not disturb her equanimity in the least; she
took it quite as a matter of course.  "It is only
Nurse's nonsense," she said, turning calmly to
Queenie; "if she talked so to the girls it would
be different, but nothing matters to me," with a
little curl of her lip and a shrug.
</p>

<p>
"I think you must miss your sisters, living
here alone?" observed Queenie, by way of
changing the subject.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as to that, papa and I miss them, of
course.  They are well enough for girls, only they
are just at the <i>gauche</i> age, you know; when they
are older I shall know better what to do with them."
</p>

<p>
"Then are you never dull?" asked Garth.  "I
should have thought Flo especially would have
left a void in the house, she was so bright and
full of fun."
</p>

<p>
"I should have called Flo noisy," exclaimed
Dora quietly.  "Busy people are never dull;
I should have thought you would have found
that out by this time."
</p>

<p>
"I know you emulate the busy bee, and improve
each shining hour, Miss Dora; but still&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you mean to be satirical," with a
little scorn.  "You men think there is no work
done but by yourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; I am sure your list of duties must
be very long," evidently teasing her, to her
father's great delight.
</p>

<p>
"Quite long enough for a woman," she returned,
pointedly.  "I have my house-keeping,
and my schools, and the mothers' meeting, and
the penny club, and the coal and blanket fund,
and the library, besides odds and ends of
business, and all my visiting.  Papa and I work
together, and in the evening I read to him."
</p>

<p>
"Dora is my right hand," interposed
Mr. Cunningham, looking at his girl fondly.
</p>

<p>
"After all men must have some one to help
them," returned Dora loftily.  She delivered herself
of her little speech Parthian-wise, as she rose
from the tea-table, turning her shoulder
somewhat upon Garth as she did so.
</p>

<p>
"Are we such helpless creatures then?" he
asked in a low voice, following her.
</p>

<p>
"Most of you are," she replied calmly.  "Miss
Marriott, the rain is over, shall we take a turn
in the garden?"
</p>

CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
TANGLED.
</h3>

<p class="intro">
"Women do not like a man the worse for having many favorites,
if he desert them all for her.  She fancies that she herself
has the power of fixing the wanderer; that other women
conquer like the Parthians, but that she herself, like the
Romans, can not only make conquests, but retain them."&mdash;<i>Colton.</i>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The conversation had now become more general;
but towards the close of the visit Queenie found
herself alone with Miss Cunningham.  They were
standing in the porch together.  Garth had gone
round to the stables to see after the waggonette,
and the others were in the Vicar's study, turning
over a portfolio of old engravings.  Queenie had
been more than half disposed to follow them, but
Miss Cunningham had detained her.
</p>

<p>
"You will find this pleasanter than papa's
dark little study; besides, he does not want us
now he has Miss Faith Palmer.  Why do men
like talking to her so much?" she continued in a
perplexed voice.  "She is not a bit clever, or
what one would call attractive, and yet
Mr. Clayton and papa are always lauding her to the
skies."
</p>

<p>
"She is very good," returned Queenie.  After
what had passed between herself and Garth she
was disposed to hold her peace on the subject of
Miss Faith's merits.  Some hours had passed
since her arrival at Crossgill Vicarage, but, strange
to say, she was less than ever inclined to be
communicative to Miss Cunningham.
</p>

<p>
"So are you and I good, at least I hope so,"
answered Dora promptly, "though we do not dress
in grey, and wear a close bonnet like a Quaker.  I
am a foe to that sort of goodness that must cloak
itself in a peculiar garb.  By-the-bye, how do you
get on with Langley Clayton? she is one of the
good sort too."
</p>

<p>
"I think she is one of the best women I ever
met," was the enthusiastic reply; "she is almost
perfection, so unselfish and so unobtrusive in
everything she does."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Langley is Langley; but she is a trifle
too melancholy for my taste.  I don't like
people to go through life in a sort of 'patience
on a monument' attitude.  One suspects all
manner of strange back-grounds, and then it is
so provoking.  Langley is Langley, of course, but
I like Cathy best."
</p>

<p>
"Have you known them long, Miss Cunningham?"
</p>

<p>
"Ever since I was so high," putting her hand
about three feet from the ground.  "I used to
call Mr. Clayton Garth once, till he got so big
and grand that he used to frighten me; not that
I am at all frightened of him or any other man
now," she continued, with a curl of her lip, "one
sees their weaknesses too plainly for that.  How
long are you going to stay at Church-stile House,
Miss Marriott?"
</p>

<p>
"About three weeks, I believe, that is, until the
cottage is ready for us.  You know, I suppose,
that we remain in Hepshaw.  I am the new
school-mistress.  Mr. Clayton and Mr. Logan
have elected me," explained Queenie simply;
but, nevertheless, making the statement with some
reluctance.  She had a notion that Miss
Cunningham would think it strange.
</p>

<p>
Dora absolutely started, and then bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
"You!  Why you must be joking!"
</p>

<p>
"No indeed, Miss Cunningham."
</p>

<p>
"Why did they not tell me?  It is Cathy's
doing, I suppose, to keep you near her, you are
great friends I hear; but I am surprised Mr. Clayton
allowed it for a moment.  You,&mdash;excuse me,
Miss Marriott, but I cannot get over my surprise,&mdash;you
look so unlike a school-mistress.  Did you
ever see your predecessor, Miss Drake?"
</p>

<p>
Queenie shook her head.  She felt a little
discomposed; the cool scrutiny of the blue eyes did
not please her.  Dora's searching glance took in
every detail&mdash;the well-gloved hands, the dainty
French tie, the little brown hat with its pheasant's
wing, all the finish and detail that marks the
gentlewoman's taste.
</p>

<p>
"No, you are not much like Miss Drake," she
replied coldly; and a little cloud of dissatisfaction
and perplexity knitted her brow.
</p>

<p>
They both seemed relieved when Garth made
his appearance with the waggonette.  Dora at
once went in search of the rest of the party.
Miss Faith and Emmie joined them instantly,
but Cathy still lingered.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Catherine, come, it is getting late,"
exclaimed her brother impatiently; "you and
Miss Dora have gossiped enough by this time."  Cathy
gave him a laughing look as she jumped
into the waggonette, and ensconced herself cosily
by Queenie.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be cross, Garth.  No one calls me
Catherine but Mr. Logan and Miss Cosie.  I
have only been mystifying Dora on the subject of
our young friend here.  She seems 'struck all of
a heap'&mdash;to use an elegant but most expressive
phrase&mdash;at the notion of her turning school-mistress.
What business of hers is it, I should
like to know?  Let her mind her own parish."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Cathy, be quiet; she will hear you,"
interposed Garth sharply, as he turned round to
wave an adieu to the little figure in the porch.
Dora stood with her hand shading her eyes,
watching them until they were out of sight.  She
looked still more like a picture framed in roses,
her straw hat hanging on her arm, and the
sunset shining on her fair hair.
</p>

<p>
Garth turned round more than once, and then
he resumed the subject somewhat irritably.
</p>

<p>
"What has Dora got in her head, I should
like to know? she looks as if something does not
please her.  What nonsense have you been
talking, Cathy?"
</p>

<p>
"Plaze your honor, no nonsense at all, at all,"
began Cathy mischievously, but a glance at her
brother's side face, which looked unusually grave,
sobered her in time.  "Garth, don't be such a
griffin, or I will never take you out to tea again.
Dora chose to cross-examine me as to Miss
Marriott's motives in taking so singular a step as
becoming our school-mistress, and I thought her
curiosity somewhat impertinent, and so took a
delight in baffling it."
</p>

<p>
"I think it was you who were impertinent,
Cathy," returned Garth, still displeased.  "Surely
such an old friend as Dora has a right to interest
herself in our affairs if she likes."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," returned his sister haughtily;
"besides, this is not our affair at all, it is
Queenie's.  What right has any one to poke and
pry into her motives?  Of course you always take
Dora's part, you and Langley are alike in that;
but she got nothing out of me."
</p>

<p>
"My dear Cathy, Miss Cunningham is perfectly
welcome to know everything, as far as I am
concerned," interrupted Queenie, somewhat distressed
at this argument.  These slight diversities
of opinion were not unusual between Cathy and
her brother; but Queenie had never before heard
him express himself so strongly.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you take such a sensible view of
it," returned Garth, mollified in an instant.
"Cathy is thoughtless with her tongue
sometimes, and hurts people.  Miss Cunningham
always takes a lively interest in all that concerns
Hepshaw; you see, their own parish is managed
so admirably, Crossgill is quite a model village
in every way, that she feels she has some
authority in speaking."
</p>

<p>
"All meddlers have authority, self-imposed,
of course," observed Cathy, <i>sotto voce</i>.
Nevertheless, the remark reached Garth's ears.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you so hard on Dora this
evening?" he asked, good-humoredly.  "She
deserves a good scolding, does she not, Miss
Faith?  You are generally such good friends;
something has gone wrong to-night, eh, little
one?"
</p>

<p>
He spoke coaxingly, but Cathy would not be
induced to answer.  "She was sick of Dora; she
would have Dora on the brain if they did not
change the subject," was her pettish reply, and,
seeing her in this humor, Garth, like a wise man,
dropped the subject.  But the conversation made
a painful impression on Queenie; in her heart
she sided with Cathy.  She thought Miss
Cunningham's curiosity unjustifiable in the last
degree.  "What is it to her how long I remain
in Church-Stile House and in Hepshaw?" she said
proudly to herself.
</p>

<p>
This feeling was not mollified when, two days
afterwards, Cathy informed her that Miss
Cunningham had driven over in her little
basket-carriage, and was at that moment talking to
Langley in the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Queenie changed color a little as she put down
her book.
</p>

<p>
"So soon!" she ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she has come to return our call, and to
see Langley," with a meaning look, that made
Queenie feel still more uncomfortable.  "No; we
need not go to her just yet; Langley will bring
her out to us by-and-bye.  I think I shall tell
Susan to let us have some tea, it is so
delightfully cool and shady under these trees."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a moment, Cathy," catching hold of
her dress, as she brushed past her, on hospitable
thoughts intent.  "Tell me why you do not like
Miss Cunningham."
</p>

<p>
"But I do like her," returned Cathy, opening
her eyes widely.  "Who has said anything to the
contrary?  I think she is a dear little thing, and
as good as gold.  Why her father and sisters
dote on her; only they have spoiled her between
them."
</p>

<p>
"Then what put you out so the other night?"
persisted Queenie.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, that is a complaint to which I am
often subject.  Many things put me out, you do
sometimes, and so does Garth, dear, stupid,
blundering old fellow that he is."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but, Cathy, do be serious; you were as
cross as possible that evening with Miss Cunningham,
and would not say anything in her favor."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I believe I was cross," candidly.  "If
there be one thing I hate it is to be managed,
and Dora will try to manage people.  It is all
very well in Crossgill, where every one worships
the ground she treads on,&mdash;and of course she is
very clever, and does no end of good,&mdash;but it is
different when she tries to manage us here.  It
will be time enough for that when,&mdash;that is,
if,&mdash;but I think I will leave that part of my
sentence unfinished," continued Cathy, provokingly,
and she ran away into the house, leaving
Queenie still more mystified and uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
Tea had long been set out on the low table
under the plane-tree before Langley made her
appearance with their visitor.  The blue cambric
and the broad-brimmed hat, wreathed with wild
convolvoli, seemed quite familiar to Queenie.
Dora held out her hand to her with perfect good
humor; perhaps her manner was a trifle condescending.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have come over to talk to you, and
hear all about it," she said, taking possession of
Garth's favorite basket-work chair, and unfastening
her hat in her old fashion.  "Papa says that
I am too fond of interfering in every one's
business, and that the world would go on just
as well without me; but I can never believe
that," with a low laugh, as though the idea
amused her.  "Fancy Crossgill and papa without
me!" folding her dimpled hands complacently.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say they would do very well,"
interrupted Cathy, who was hovering near her with
some rosebuds in her hands.  Dora calmly helped
herself to some, and went on talking.
</p>

<p>
"They will have to do without me some day,
of course.  It is a woman's duty to marry, and I
suppose I must submit to my destiny.  The girls
will be sad managers; but no one could expect
me to remain an old maid on their account.  I
have brought them up, and when I have introduced
them into society I shall consider that I
have done my duty."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear," interposed Garth from the
back-ground, so suddenly that even Langley
started.  Queenie thought that now, at least,
Miss Cunningham must look conscious and
confused; but she did nothing of the kind; she
only faced round coolly on the interloper, and
asked what he meant by eaves-dropping in that
fashion?
</p>

<p>
Garth laughed and made himself comfortable
on his old grey plaid at her feet; but he looked
a little mischievous.
</p>

<p>
"So there are limits to your sisterly
self-sacrifice after all?"  Dora gave a slight
shrug.
</p>

<p>
"Self-sacrifice, without limits and without
common-sense, remind one of the Suttee and the
car of Juggernaut.  When one is speaking generally
it is a pity to particularize.  At present I
have too much on my hands to trouble about my
future.  There are the girls, and Flo is always in
scrapes, and wanting me," finished Dora, in a
quiet, matter-of-fact way.
</p>

<p>
"But Flo is nearly sixteen!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and Beatrix is seventeen.  I mean
Beatrix to remain at Brussels another year, in
spite of papa and nurse; she is young for her
age, and is far too shy and unformed to bring out
at present; Flo has much more in her.  But I
did not come over here to talk about the girls
and myself," continued Dora frankly; "they are
good girls of course, but they are much more
trouble than if they had been boys.  I wanted a
chat with Miss Marriott, and to hear all about
this school business.  I have had to do with
schools all my life, you know," turning to
Queenie; "and we have a charming place for
our mistress at Crossgill.  I have all sorts of
ideas in my head, and shall be able to help you,"
ran on Dora, in a brisk, business-like way that
almost took away Queenie's breath.
</p>

<p>
"You are very kind," she began, hesitatingly,
and then she stopped.  What business was it of
Miss Cunningham's? why need she brook patronage
from a girl so little older than herself, and a
perfect stranger?  But Dora misconstrued her
momentary hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you need not mind troubling me, I take
interest in all sorts of people and things.  Papa
calls it interference, but I know better.  Most
people content themselves with their own little
sphere of duty, and don't trouble themselves
beyond it, but every one is welcome to my advice
or assistance."
</p>

<p>
An inexplicable smile crossed Garth's face, but
he made no remark.  A close observer might have
said that he was watching the two faces before
him, with a view to comparison.  Dora made a
pretty picture as she leant back in her low
basket-chair, with her sunny hair, and the roses fastened
in her blue cambric.  Queenie looked a little
sombre and shadowy beside her in her brown
dress.  Her eyes were down-cast; she looked
disturbed and ill-at-ease; she had lost
something of the brightness and independence that
were her chief charms.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like talking about myself and my
own affairs," she said, with natural reserve; but
somehow it sounded ungracious in her own ears.
Miss Cunningham was an old friend of the family;
perhaps she was wrong in treating her like a
stranger; but Dora was not repulsed by her
coldness.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you feel a little proud about it; I
should in your position," with a patronizing
kindness that made Queenie's cheeks burn.  "Miss
Drake was such a very different person, quite
common-place and ordinary.  I think she was a
small tradesman's daughter.  It must be difficult
to fit yourself to such a position, to come down
to it with dignity."  But Queenie would hear no
more.
</p>

<p>
"You talk as though I were somebody, and
not a poor governess, Miss Cunningham.  I
hope it is not beneath a clergyman's daughter to
teach the children of honest people.  It is not
the work, it is the motive that ennobles the
worker," cried the girl, turning on her young
adviser with burning cheeks, and her eyes
suddenly shining.  "If I teach the children of the
poor, I remember that I am poor myself.  I shall
not be ashamed of my position, or forget that my
mother was a lady.  I cannot forget what is due
to myself or her, or to Emmie's mother, who
brought me up, and made me what I am."
</p>

<p>
Dora raised her pretty eyebrows in some surprise;
this little burst of sentiment perplexed
her.
</p>

<p>
"I did not know you were such an impulsive
character, Miss Marriott.  You remind me of Flo
a little, it is just her way of breaking out when
she is lectured; not that I am presuming to
lecture you," with an amused look; "I am only
offering you advice and assistance.  Miss Drake
and I used to have long talks, did we not,
Langley? and settle all sorts of things.  She was
a very ordinary person, and a little commonplace,
I must confess, but she was always ready
to take advice."
</p>

<p>
"I fear you will not find me quite so submissive
as Miss Drake.  I am only humble to those
whom I know and love, and who love me!"
replied Queenie, with a soft unsteady smile.
"You are very good, Miss Cunningham; but I do
not see how you can help me in this.  I have
Langley and Cathy, and they trust me a little,"
finished the girl, with a touching inflexion in her
voice; "and for the rest, it is hard uphill work,
and I must fight my way alone;" and then, as
though to put a stop to the argument, she rose
and placed herself by Langley's side.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand.  I hope she does not
think me interfering.  Perhaps she does not know
that Hepshaw is a sort of second home to me!"
returned Dora, in unfeigned perplexity, turning
to Garth.  Rebuffs were unknown to her; she was
far too used to worship to take them kindly;
her face changed and clouded a little.  "I call
it such a pity to show this sort of feeling in such
a position.  You have all of you made a mistake,
Mr. Clayton; she is far above her work."
</p>

<p>
"There you are wrong," replied Garth warmly.
Dora had risen, and he had followed her, and
they were standing by the little gate looking
down the plane-tree walk.  Some children
were planting flowers on a newly-made grave;
some one was practising on the organ; through
the open door they could hear snatches of
Bach's Passion music.  "Believe me, you are
wrong; Miss Marriott's a fine creature.  She
thinks nothing beneath her, and would work
herself to death for that little sister of hers.
You are both good creatures; I wonder why
you persist in misunderstanding each other?" he
continued in an aggrieved voice, and with a
man's usual blindness in such cases.  "I am
disappointed that you do not care more for
Langley's <i>protégée</i>, Miss Dora."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as to that, I like her well enough," she
returned, a little coolly; "she is in good style
and lady-like, only far too impulsive for my taste.
She reminds me of Flo, and you know I always
find Flo rather troublesome."
</p>

<p>
"I know your conduct to your sisters is
perfectly admirable," was the answer.  "You have
been a mother to them in every sense of the
word.  Why Flo perfectly adores you, Dora."
</p>

<p>
"I am used to being adored," she returned
quietly.  It had not escaped her notice that he
had gone back to his old habit, and called her
Dora; she rather liked it than otherwise.  It
was very pleasant lingering by the little gate in
the sunset.  She was quite aware how pretty
a picture she made, with her uncovered hair,
and the roses in the blue cambric.  Garth, tall
and dark, and in his grey working suit, made a
splendid foil to her.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we take a turn on the terrace?" he
asked in a low voice, unlatching the little gate as
he spoke; but Dora shook her head.  It would
be very pleasant wandering there in the sunset
with Garth Clayton; but then there were the
girls, and Flo not sixteen yet.  Things were
progressing certainly, but perhaps, under the
circumstances, it would not be wise to expedite
matters.  Her sisters must be introduced into
society, and Beatrix must be trained to take her
position at Crossgill Vicarage before she could
turn her attentions to such things.  There must
be no loitering in the sunset just now; men were
impressionable, and well, perhaps Garth's manner
was a little different to-day; he certainly looked
a little disconsolate over her refusal.
</p>

<p>
"I shall gather you some roses before you go;
you won't refuse them I hope, Dora," he returned,
somewhat discontentedly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you may gather me some; but you
must not call me Dora, please.  It is a great
pity, but we are not children now, and people
will talk."
</p>

<p>
"Let them talk," returned Garth, now really
provoked.  He was very proud, and this repulse
did not suit him.  The sunset was inviting, and
the shining little head beside him seemed to draw
him with golden meshes.  He was half serious and
half jesting, but the mood and the hour had a
certain sweetness not to be lightly lost; but if
she chose to repulse him, well, it had not gone
very far, and on the whole he preferred his
freedom; but here Dora was looking at him
pathetically with her blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Are you cross with me? one cannot always
please one's self.  Papa will want me; and one has
so many duties," sighed the young diplomatist,
"and cannot choose one's pleasures," looking at
him slyly, but with a certain softness.
</p>

<p>
"No; you are very good.  I suppose I am
like other men, and want my own way.  Do you
think if you had more to do with me that you
could cure me, Dora?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush, here comes Miss Marriott," she
returned, laying her hand warningly on his arm.
It was a very pretty hand, and showed well on
the grey coat-sleeve.  He had called her Dora
again, but she did not again rebuke him; somehow
his tenacity did not displease her.  "He will
be troublesome by-and-bye, but I think I shall
be able to manage him," she thought, as she
turned with a somewhat heightened color to the
new-comer.
</p>

<p>
Queenie came between them as they fell apart;
she was not thinking of them just now, but of
something that she had schooled herself to say.
</p>

<p>
"I told Langley that I must come after you,
and she said that I was right.  I wanted to say,
Miss Cunningham, that I was wrong just now.
I ought to have thanked you more for your
interest and what you said to me; you meant it
kindly, very kindly, I am sure."  Queenie spoke
in rather a measured voice, as though she were
repeating a lesson; but Dora received the apology
very graciously.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you would think better of it, only
you were so impulsive, and missed my meaning.
People always take my advice in the end, they
find it answers.  They know that I take interest
and want to help them."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and I ought not to reject any well-meant
kindness," returned Queenie, with still
more effort, as she noticed Garth's keen survey of
them both.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad that you have decided that we are
to be friends and not enemies," replied Dora
calmly, but half-amused by what she termed an
exaggeration of feeling.  "I know I shall get on
with you better than with Miss Drake.  She was
such a very ordinary person, and dressed so very
oddly."
</p>

<p>
"There is no comparison between Miss
Marriott and Miss Drake," interposed Garth, a
little sharply.  "Let every one stand on their
own merits."
</p>

<p>
"You are perfectly right," was the composed
answer.  "I am only glad that we all understand
each other so well.  I shall come and see you in
your cottage, Miss Marriott, and then I am sure
we shall become friends."
</p>

<p>
Queenie did not answer, but a rebellious flush
rose to her cheek.  She had come between them,
and was still standing there on the little path.
The children had planted their flowers and had
gone home.  The music had ceased, and the
organist had closed the church.  "Let us go
back to the house and to Langley," observed
Miss Cunningham a little impatiently, when the
silence had lasted a moment.  But as the girls
walked back to the house side by side Garth did
not accompany them.  He was gathering roses.

CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE KING OF KARLDALE.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "I ask thee for a thoughtful love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through constant watching wise,<br>
  To meet the glad with joyful smiles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wipe the weeping eyes;<br>
  And a heart at leisure from itself,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To soothe and sympathize."  <i>L. Waring.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A few days after Miss Cunningham's visit
Langley came into the room where the girls
were sitting as usual, chatting merrily over their
work.
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, do you think you could spare Queenie
to us for a few hours?"
</p>

<p>
"That depends upon circumstances, my dear,
was the cool response.
</p>

<p>
"Because Garth and I want her.  I have just
had a letter from Gertrude, and she and Harry
wish us to go over there to-morrow; she is very
unwell, I fear, and Garth thinks it would be
such a good opportunity to show Queenie the
beauties of Karlsmere."
</p>

<p>
"Why should we not all go?  Do go and coax
him, Langley."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I cannot," replied Langley earnestly.
"Gertrude is such an invalid that we cannot
fatigue her with numbers.  No, it is no use
teasing him," as Cathy made an impetuous movement
to the door; "he has quite decided that he
will only take Queenie and me.  I thought it
was very nice of him proposing it," with a
deprecating glance at her sister's disappointed
face; "it will be a treat for Queenie; and you
know in another week or so she will have to
begin work in earnest."
</p>

<p>
"You and Garth never care for me to go over
to Karldale," began Cathy a little crossly, but
Langley stopped her rather hurriedly.  She was
a trifle moved from her ordinary composure;
her face looked more worn and anxious than
usual; a nervous flush glowed in her thin
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, you never will believe in Gertrude's
ill-health.  I am sadly troubled about her, and so
is Garth."
</p>

<p>
"I have small sympathy for people who are
always calling 'wolf,'" replied Cathy, taking up
her work again.  "I believe Gertrude's temper
is most in fault."
</p>

<p>
"Then we will not argue about it," returned
her sister, with a little sigh.  She was very
patient, but Cathy's mood evidently jarred on
her.  Cathy threw down her work again with
such impatience that her needle broke as her
sister left the room.
</p>

<p>
"Why will she give in to that woman's whims
as she does!  I can't understand it.  Gertrude
makes a perfect slave of her when she goes there,
and actually Langley seems to like it.  She is
always going over there now; and she comes
back tired out and fit for nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, I think it vexes Langley
dreadfully when, you depreciate Mrs. Chester; I
have noticed it more than once," observed
Queenie, in her shrewd way.
</p>

<p>
"I know it does, and my wretched temper
makes me do it all the more; but Langley is
such a patient old dear that I hate to see her
domineered over and victimized by a woman
like Gertrude.  When I see her with that worried
look in her face I am always ten times more
bitter; and then I am so fond of Harry, and
Karlsmere would be so delicious this weather,
and I own I was cross," continued Cathy, with
the frankness that made her so lovable; "but
of course you must go to please them, and
Emmie and I will spend the day with Miss Cosie."
</p>

<p>
Queenie was thankful that the matter was so
amicably settled; but since her friend was not
to join in her pleasure she would not dwell on
her own anticipations, delightful as they were;
but in her heart she thought how good it was of
Mr. Clayton to include her in their little trip.
Since that day in the granite quarry his manner
had insensibly changed to her; always kind and
gentle, it was now tinged with stronger interest.
A pleasant cordiality marked their intercourse;
he was always thoughtful for her comfort and
pleasure.  Unconsciously, Queenie was beginning
to depend for much of her present happiness
upon this friendship with Garth Clayton.  "It is
almost as good as having a brother of my own,"
she said once to Cathy.  Queenie's hard-working
life, with its stern, morbid realities, had left her
scant leisure for the ordinary dreams of girlhood.
She had never mapped out any bright future for
herself; possible lovers had not stolen across the
sad margin of her thoughts.  "Those things were
not for her," she had said to herself.  "Other
women had a strong arm to lean upon, other
women had fathers and brothers or husbands to
work for them, and shield them in the battle of
life; she had to work for herself and her helpless
little sister, that was all.  And so she took up
her burthen bravely, neither repining that such
things were, nor wasting her best energies with
fruitless regrets for impossibilities.  No vague
sentimentalities preyed on her healthy young
nature; no bitterness for her joyless youth marred
her sweet serenity.  Everything will be made
up to us there, I am sure of it," she would say
to herself, with tender, old-fashioned wisdom.
"One day I shall get old, and not care so much
about these things; perhaps Emmie will marry,
and I shall be aunt Queenie, and take care of
her and her children."
</p>

<p>
And so, with the courage of perfect innocence,
and with a simplicity that was perfectly free from
self-consciousness, Queenie gave herself up to the
delight of this new friendship.  There was no one
to warn her of danger; no one to bid the brave
young heart shield itself with greater reserve and
prudence, to question her of the meaning of this
strange happiness that seemed to flood her whole
being with brightness.
</p>

<p>
"Every one is so good to me, and I am so
happy," she said almost daily.  When alone her
thoughts were a perpetual thanksgiving.  An
insensible change had passed over her thoughts
with respect to Garth, she was less critical; the
defects and flaws of character she had at first
noticed in him became less apparent; his slight
arbitrariness, his condescension, his masterful
assumption of power, even his lack of deep intellect
were all unnoticed.  If he spoke, Queenie was
as ready to obey his behests as ever Langley or
Cathy were.  If his want of ambition, his perfect
content with himself and his surroundings,
sometimes surprised her, she began to credit him
with greatness of mind; or if she were too shrewd
for that, to own to herself that even his very
faults were more lovable than other people's
virtues.
</p>

<p>
"He is a sort of Bayard; he is as courteous to
me as though I were the greatest lady in the
laud, instead of a village school-mistress," said
the girl once with tears in her eyes, "And
see how good he is to those old ladies at The
Sycamores: he let Miss Hope talk to him for
a whole hour about her Temperance Society,
though I could see he was dreadfully bored by
her.  He never hurts people's feelings by letting
them see that they trouble him."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, Garth is perfection, and I am
glad you have found it out," was Cathy's reply.
</p>

<p>
Queenie found vent for her feelings in a grateful
little speech when she next saw Garth.  He
came in at the drawing-room door, throwing his
head back in his usual fashion, and shook himself
like a rough terrier.
</p>

<p>
"What a dirty fellow I look, to be sure; the
roads have quite powdered me.  I hope we shall
have rain before to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Clayton, I have been wanting to
thank you ever since I heard it.  It will be so
delightful&mdash;to-morrow I mean."
</p>

<p>
"That remains to be proved; we shall enjoy it
all the more for having you with us," was the
pleasant answer.  "I have been waiting for an
opportunity to drive you over to Karlsmere ever
since you came.  The lake is charming, and you
will get quantities of parsley fern for your cottage
garden.  By-the-bye, I have been in there this
morning, and the workmen are getting on
famously; all the holes are stopped, and there's
another coat of paint on.  I hardly knew the
place.  We shall be losing you in another fortnight,
I am afraid;" for Queenie had obstinately
refused to burthen her friends with their presence
a day longer than was necessary.
</p>

<p>
She tried to look pleased at this announcement;
but a pang crossed her in spite of herself
at the thought of leaving Church-Stile House.
The cottage seemed dull by comparison.  True,
she should often see them, and Cathy would be in
and out perpetually; but she would no longer be
his guest, sharing in the pleasant every-day life
of the family, making one in their plans, a party
to their little jokes and pleasantries.  "It is time
for me to go, I am getting spoiled amongst you
all.  I feel I have been idle long enough," she
said to her friend afterwards; but somehow she
sighed as she said it.
</p>

<p>
The day at Karlsmere proved as delightful in
reality as it was in anticipation.  Garth was in
one of his boyish, frolicsome moods.  He and
Queenie hunted for ferns, and gathered wild
flowers, while Langley walked thoughtfully beside
the margin of the beautiful lake.  It was a golden
day in Queenie's memory.  How often she recalled
that walk afterwards.  The blue shimmering
lake, so still and silent in the sunlight; the
winding roads; the steep woody height on the
farther bank; the pretty vicarage with its trim
garden and the tiny church, reminding her of a
small ill-furnished room.  The tall athletic figure
in the grey suit, vaulting lightly over the crisp
bracken high above them; the handful of wild
flowers tossed laughingly at her feet; Langley
standing on a smooth white boulder, looking
with grave unsmiling eyes at the baby waves
lapping to her feet.  How well she recalled it
all.
</p>

<p>
"There's Harry coming to meet us," shouted
Garth; but Langley did not hear him.  She
stood in that strange, self-absorbed attitude,
motionless and oblivious, till Nan ran up to her
and pulled her dress; and then the color rushed
over her pale face with surprise, and she stooped
and pressed the child closely to her.
</p>

<p>
"Little Nan, my dear little Nan," she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"I am father's Nan," lisped the child.  "I am
nobody's Nan but father's.  Father's up there,"
pointing with her fore-finger to the rocks above
them.  "He and Jeb are both there.  I carried
Jeb, but he was heavy, and my arms did ache."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you are father's Nan," repeated Langley
dreamily; "father's little comforter;" and as
she kissed the little face a sudden mist rose
before her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Why are your eyes wet when you kiss me?"
questioned Nan curiously, "and why do you
always kiss me so close, so close?  Mammie never
does; but only father, only father and you."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Nan; I love you.  Do you hear me,
Nan?  I love you dearly, dearly."  Langley
spoke in a strange, stifled voice, but the child
only gazed at her in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"You need not cry about it.  You know father
loves me too, but he never cries over me.
Mammie does; but then she pushes me away."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, poor mother is ill, you know."
</p>

<p>
Nan reflected a moment gravely.  "Yes; her
head did ache.  She said 'Go away, Nan, you
tire me; go to father and Jeb;' and I did go.
Mammie does not love Nan much."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush, my darling, hush! poor mother!"
</p>

<p>
"She did often say 'Go away, Nan; Nan is
naughty.'  But Nan is good, always good; father
says so."
</p>

<p>
"What are you talking to Langley about, you
little chatter-box?  Here is Jeb whining his heart
out for you," called out Mr. Chester from the
bank above them.  "Stay where you are, pet,
and father will come and carry you."
</p>

<p>
"Father's coming," echoed Nan placidly.  She
stood quite quiet and patiently while he talked
to Langley; but when he lifted her in his arms
she seemed to nestle into them with a little coo
of content.  Once or twice during their walk her
father stooped over her and peered into the
white sun-bonnet rather anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"She is not quite as strong as she was, and
seems to tire sooner," he said to Langley.
"Gertrude tells me I am wrong to let the child
go about so much in the heat.  But what am I
to do?  When I leave her at home she makes
herself ill with fretting.  Naughty Nan," in a
tone of infinite tenderness.
</p>

<p>
"Nan always good," was the somewhat drowsy answer.
</p>

<p>
"God bless her, so she is, my little white
angel.  Look at her, Langley; this is just what
she does: she always falls asleep in my arms like
this.  Sometimes she is so heavy that I am
obliged to put her down.  I wonder how I
should feel if I were a poor man on the tramp,
with my child in my arms, and the world before
me.  I wonder, too, what mammie would do
without us," as Nan opened her dark eyes, roused
by the suppressed vehemence of her father's
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Mammy did say 'Go away, Nan; Nan makes
mammy's head to ache.'"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid mammy says that far too often,"
was the somewhat bitter reply.  "It seems hard
for a mother never to be able to bear her child's
presence."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  Miss Marriott will hear you, Harry!"
interposed Langley, gently.  Mr. Chester looked
round and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No; they are too far behind, and seem
engrossed with each other's conversation.  Look
here, Langley, we are old friends, and you know
all our troubles, and I tell you truly, things are
getting worse every day."
</p>

<p>
Langley's pale face turned paler, but she made
no answer.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I think if I could only see
Gertrude happy and contented I should not
mind what became of me; I wear out my heart
to please her.  I do not think she has ever heard
a harsh word from me since I married her; can
any husband do more?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; you are good, very good, to her,"
was the almost inaudible reply.
</p>

<p>
"And yet it has come to this, that I have no
wife and no home, for without sympathy how
can one be said to possess either.  If she would
only greet me with a smile sometimes; if she
had a kind word for me or this child; but you
heard what she said just now.  She is a sensitive
little creature, and I fully believe her mother's
indifference pains her."
</p>

<p>
"Harry, indeed, indeed, you must not be hard
upon Gertrude; if you only knew how she
suffers."
</p>

<p>
"Do I not know it?  She will not be long
with us, my poor Gertie, I am sure of that; she
is wasting every day, Langley; Dr. Marshall says
so.  That is what makes it so bitter to think
there can be no peace now.  If I could only
make her happy; if I could be sure that she has
not repented of marrying me; but sometimes I
think that if I had left her amongst her own
people she would not be pining herself to death
as she is now."
</p>

<p>
A look of intense pain crossed Langley's face.
</p>

<p>
"You must not think that."
</p>

<p>
"But how am I to help it, when I see her
drooping and wasting before my eyes, my own
wife, whom I have sworn to cherish?  Sometimes
I dread that she will tell me so; and then, how
am I to bear it?"
</p>

<p>
"Gertrude will never tell you so;" but
Mr. Chester shook his head.  "She will never tell you
so," repeated Langley in a steadier voice.  "In
spite of her unhappy nature Gertrude is a good
woman.  Harry, you always listen to me as if&mdash;as
if I were your sister; do try and believe what
I say this once."
</p>

<p>
"What am I to believe?"
</p>

<p>
"That it is not your fault.  Gertrude says you
are goodness itself to her and the child;
sometimes she speaks of you both so tenderly.  Why
will you not go on bearing things as you have
done, so patiently, so nobly, and trust that
Providence will bring good out of all this evil?"
</p>

<p>
"Then you think that there is nothing that I
can do for her.  I half hoped that you would find
out something that she wanted, some wish that
she might express."
</p>

<p>
"Then I will let you know," replied Langley,
with assumed cheerfulness.  In reality her heart
was as heavy as lead, the talk had oppressed her.
Ever ready with her sympathy she had yet found
it hard to comfort him.  What comfort could
there be in such a home&mdash;a hasty, ill-assorted
marriage, defective sympathy, inequalities of
temper, physical sufferings impatiently borne, the
daily burthen of sickness without ameliorating
circumstances, and all this patiently, nay,
heroically endured.  What was she to say but that he
was blameless?  Whose fault was it that all this
had come upon him? that he was walking by
her side, groaning aloud for once in the very
heaviness of his spirit?  What could her words
be to him but meaningless truisms, that must
fall flatly on his ear?  Had she any comfort at
all to offer him? was not such comfort placed
beyond his reach and hers for ever?
</p>

<p>
Unconsciously she slackened her pace as such
thoughts came to her, and in a few minutes the
others joined them, and the conversation became
general.
</p>

<p>
Queenie was delighted with the look of the
Grange, as Mr. Chester's house was called.  It
was a rambling grey stone house, standing just
at the head of the lake; a picturesque old
archway embosomed with ivy admitted them into a
place half garden, half orchard, with a low fence
dividing it from the crofts; the large square hall
was used as a summer sitting-room.  From the
inner room a tall dark-eyed woman advanced
languidly to meet them, wrapped up, in spite of
the summer day, in a costly Indian shawl.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gertie, I have brought your friends,"
exclaimed her husband, cheerfully; "I met
them half way down the lake.  I hope you have
not been expecting us before."
</p>

<p>
"You must have dawdled on your way then,"
returned Mrs. Chester fretfully, "for I have been
waiting for at least an hour, until I thought I
should have been too nervous to receive them;
but that is the way when you get with Langley,
Harry, you never remember poor me."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure we walked here straight enough,"
replied Mr. Chester hastily; but Langley, with a
sweet look, stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"We have ventured to bring our friend, Miss
Marriott, Gertrude; Garth wanted to show her
Karlsmere.  She knows what an invalid you are,
and will not make any demands on your strength.
Now you must go and establish yourself
comfortably on your couch, while Queenie and I get
rid of some of our dust, and Harry puts dear little
Nan in her crib."
</p>

<p>
"I tell Harry that he is killing that child, by
dragging her about in the sun," rejoined Mrs. Chester,
with a shrug of her shoulders.  "He will
not listen to me.  One would think he had a
dozen children, and could afford to lose one or
two; but there, it is no use my talking to
him."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Gertie, I thought you said that your
head was bad, and that Nan was worrying you,"
observed her husband in a deprecating voice.
</p>

<p>
"Well, but she might be playing up-stairs with
her Noah's Ark.  Of course I am only a mother,
and don't understand children; but look how
flushed her face is, Langley."
</p>

<p>
"She is only rosy with sleep," interrupted
Garth, stooping to kiss her.  "What a pretty little
face it is!  She is more like you than Harry,"
continued the artful young diplomatist; "she has
got your eyes and eyelashes, Mrs. Chester."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she is very like you, Gertie," replied her
husband eagerly.  "Garth is right; I never saw
it so plainly before."
</p>

<p>
"Other people have always seen it," was the
somewhat pointed answer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Langley, I don't like her at all,"
exclaimed Queenie, when she found herself alone
with Langley in the large pleasant room
overlooking the crofts.  "I always thought Cathy
was prejudiced; but I think her so&mdash;so disagreeable."
</p>

<p>
"She has been waiting for us, you see, and that
always makes her nervous; one must make
allowance for an invalid's humor."
</p>

<p>
"Some invalids are quite pleasant," returned
Queenie stoutly.  "There is a fretful chord in her
voice that jars somehow.  She is very slim and
elegant, and I suppose some people would call her
handsome; but I don't like her gloomy dark
eyes, and her mouth goes down at the corners.
I always distrust people's tempers when I see
that."
</p>

<p>
"I did not know that you were such an
observer, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"I know when people's faces please me, and
when I shall get to love them," was the oracular
rejoinder.  "I could never love Mrs. Chester,
Langley, though I might get to pity her in
time," and Langley attempted no further defence.
</p>

<p>
Queenie found her first impressions only
deepened as the day went on.  There was a
carping fretfulness in Mrs. Chester's manner to her
husband that must have provoked a less sweet
temper, but at times he scarcely seemed to notice
it.  When the child was in the room she seemed
to engross all his attention; when she was
absent he appeared restless and ill-at-ease.  "She
can be pleasant to every one but to him," Queenie
thought to herself.  "Cathy was right when she
said that she detested that woman."
</p>

<p>
But even Queenie and Cathy might have found
some pity in their youthful intolerance if they
had overheard the brief fragments of a
conversation that passed between Mrs. Chester and
Langley.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gertrude, I know it is hard; but if you
would only try, for his and the child's sake, to
control yourself a little; you do not know how
unhappy you are making him."
</p>

<p>
"Does he complain of me to you?" she demanded
fiercely; "that would be manly and
generous on his part."
</p>

<p>
"Do you want me to leave off talking to
you?" replied Langley in a tone of genuine grief.
"Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude, what will you say
next?  Do you wish to know what he did really
say?  He asked me if there was nothing he could
do for you.  He begged me to find out if there
was any wish that he could gratify; he&mdash;but I
cannot repeat it.  If you had only heard what
he said!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Chester rose feverishly from her couch
and caught hold of Langley's dress.
</p>

<p>
"There it is.  No, don't turn from me, don't
look so shocked; you know it is his very
goodness that makes me worse.  Why is he so good
to me when I try him so?  Sometimes I think
that I am possessed with some sort of evil spirit;
I can't help tormenting him.  Oh, Langley, why
did he insist on my marrying him? why did he
not leave me in my old home when he knew,
when I told him, that I could not ever care
for him as I could for that other? when&mdash;"
but Langley stopped her with a face of
horror.
</p>

<p>
"Hush! don't mention his name!  Harry's
wife can have no remembrance of that sort.
You are a good woman, Gertrude; I have always
said so."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," she returned, bursting into tears;
"don't judge me out of your merciful heart,
Langley.  I have never been a good wife to
Harry, and I never shall.  I try to forget, but the
effort is killing me.  Oh, why did he not leave
me in my old home, and not have doomed us
both to this misery?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! you are not yourself to-day!  I
cannot hear you talk any more in this way;" and
Langley rose, pale and resolute.  "Put yourself
and your unhappiness aside, it is too late to talk
of such things now; think only of the duty you
owe to Harry and your little child."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my little child, who will so soon be
without a mother," she returned, weeping
passionately; but Langley only stooped over her with
sad dry eyes, and, kissing her, bade God bless
her, and turned away.

A GOLDEN HARVEST.

<p class="intro2">
  "Yes; keep me calm, though loud and rude<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sounds my ears that greet;<br>
  Calm in the closet's solitude,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm in the bustling street;<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It had been arranged that Queenie should return
to Carlisle for a day or two before entering
on her new duties, leaving Emmie behind her at
Church-Stile House.  She must bid good-bye to
her old friend, Caleb Runciman, and redeem her
promise of seeing Mr. Calcott again.  A brisk
correspondence had been kept up between her
and Caleb.  The old man had expressed himself
well satisfied with her plans, though many and
sore were his regrets at losing her and his little
favorite.  "I told Mr. Calcott your intention, as
you wished me, my dear," wrote Caleb, in his
cramped neat hand.  "He received the news in
silence, but after a while he muttered, 'Well,
well, it will do for a time; but it seems strange.
Frank Marriott's daughter a village school-mistress!'
and then he asked, querulously, if the
girl were coming back?  I think he misses you,
my dear, though not more than I do; and what
we shall do without you and the precious lamb
is more than Molly and I can tell; but she has
got your old room ready, and has baked a
first-rate cake; and there's a warm welcome waiting
for you, Miss Queenie, my dear; so no more
at present, from your attached friend, Caleb
Runciman."
</p>

<p>
The day after their return from Karlsmere, as
they were sitting at breakfast, Garth looked up
rather suddenly from the paper he was reading.
"Miss Marriott, I am afraid you have lost a
friend," he said, rather abruptly.  "Andrew
Calcott of Carlisle is dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Andrew!  Oh, poor Uncle Andrew!"
exclaimed Emmie, mournfully; but Queenie only
started and turned pale.
</p>

<p>
"By some mistake the announcement has been
postponed; he died three days ago.  Ah, there
is the postman coming up the walk.  I should
not be surprised if you have another letter from
your old friend, Mr. Runciman."
</p>

<p>
Garth was right; but Queenie rose from the
table and carried off the letter to read in the
privacy of her own room.  Cathy found her
quietly crying over it when she went up some
time afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"I did not think I should have minded it so
much," she said, drying her eyes as Cathy
entered; "but it seems so dreadful, his dying
alone in the night, with no one near him.
Perhaps Caleb was right, and he may have
passed away in his sleep."
</p>

<p>
"Is that all they know about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; they just went up in the morning, and
found him lying there quite cold, with a smile
on his face.  He never would let any one stay
in his room; that was one of his peculiarities.
Caleb knew this would happen one night, but he
seems dreadfully down about it.  I am to go
over next Thursday, you know, and he says this
need not make any difference."
</p>

<p>
"You will be sorry that you have not seen
him again."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it is that that troubles me.  I cannot
bear to think that I have been enjoying myself
all this time, and that he has been missing me.
I remember now, that he seemed to think that it
was good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Queenie's bright spirits were quenched for the
remainder of the day.  Her tender heart was
grieved by the thought of the lonely death-bed.
Garth found her looking still pale and depressed
when he came back from the works.  To distract
her thoughts he took her and Cathy for a long
country walk, from which they did not return
until late in the evening.  He had never been
more gentle to her, Queenie remembered
afterwards.  He and Cathy had restrained their high
spirits, and had only talked to her of what roused
and interested her&mdash;of the school, the cottage,
and plans for her new life.  Walking back in the
moonlight, their conversation flowed in graver
channels.  He and Cathy talked of their mother;
and Queenie for the first time had a clue to the
passionate devotion with which Garth regarded
her memory.
</p>

<p>
She bade good-bye to her friends rather sadly
when the day arrived for her to go back to
Carlisle.  She was only to be absent three days,
and yet the separation caused her an effort.
Why had the place grown so suddenly dear to
her that it cost her a pang only to turn her back
upon it?
</p>

<p>
Garth and Cathy accompanied her to the station.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know what I shall do without you,
Queen," exclaimed her friend, disconsolately.
</p>

<p>
"We shall all miss you, Miss Marriott," echoed
Garth, brightly.  "Take care of yourself, and
come back to us as soon as you can."  And the
pleasant words lingered long in her memory.
</p>

<p>
But, in spite of herself, her journey was a dull
one.  Mr. Calcott's sudden death still oppressed
her.  The day was sultry and sunless; heavy
thunder-clouds brooded on the edge of the
horizon; the air was surcharged with electricity;
a storm seemed impending.  It broke upon her
long before she arrived at her destination.
Queenie sat quietly in her place and watched the
fierce play of the elements, half fascinated and
half bewildered; a vague excitement seemed
roused in her, a strange disturbance and sense of
change oppressed her.
</p>

<p>
"I am just the same, and yet I feel different,"
she said to herself; "I suppose this storm
excites me.  I wonder if he meant it when he
said he would miss me, or if it was only his way;
he must always say something pleasant.  I
wonder if he would be very sorry if I were never
to come back.  Would it make any difference to
him, really?  They are all going to the Abbey
this evening; how I wish I could be with them;
but this is unkind to my poor Caleb.  I am
ashamed to think how selfish I am getting.  I
will try not to think of Hepshaw or
Church-Stile House until Monday;" but, in spite
of her good resolutions, her thoughts had
travelled there again before another half-hour
had elapsed.
</p>

<p>
The storm had ceased, but the rain was still
pouring steadily down as Queenie plodded
through the streets of Carlisle.  She had to pass
Granite Lodge on her way to Caleb's; but the
sight of the grim portico made her shiver and
avert her eyes.  She gave quite a sigh of relief
when she found herself in the dark entry of
Caleb's house, with Molly's bright face smiling
at her.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, the master's in there.  Master, master,
here's our young lady come an hour before her
time," vociferated the good woman, dropping
curtseys profusely in her excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Molly, my dear creature, you need, not
to be so ceremonious," exclaimed Queenie, pressing
the hard hand between both her own; "it is
only Miss Queenie; surely you have not forgotten
me in this little time."
</p>

<p>
"No; but I must not forget my manners to
my betters," returned Molly, coloring and
dropping another hurried curtsey.  "But go in there,
my dear young lady.  I think he is a bit dazed
with his sleep, or something, or he would have
come out to meet you."
</p>

<p>
Caleb rose from his chair rather feebly as she
entered; his blue eyes had certainly a dazed look
in them.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Queenie, my dear," he said, rather
tremulously, "I am not so young as I was,
and things sadly upset me.  Molly is a good
creature, but her intelligence is limited.  I have
wanted you badly the last few days, you and the
precious lamb."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Caleb, if I had known that I would
certainly have brought Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"No, no need; it is only an old man's whim;
she is better off where she is.  I have been trying
to write to you the last day or two, Miss Queenie,
my dear; but I got so flurried and made such
poor beginnings that I was obliged to give it up,
not being so young as I was, my dear, and soon
upset by what's over and gone."
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid it has been a sad shock to you,"
observed Queenie, gravely.  Caleb's wrinkled
hand was quite cold and shaking, and Queenie
rubbed it in a soft, caressing way as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You might have knocked me over with a
feather," returned Caleb, reverting to his favorite
expression.  "It was not so much the shock of
his death, though I have worked for him, boy
and man, just fifty-five years last Michaelmas,
nor the manner of it, for he slept away as
peaceful as an infant; it is what came after, the
mysterious dealings of Providence; but I must
have my pipe, saving your presence, Miss Queenie
dear.  And you must have something to eat and
drink to keep up your strength; and then you
and me will have a deal of comfortable talk
together, when we are both more composed;"
and Queenie, seeing how agitated the old man
really was, yielded with her usual sweet
unselfishness, and went up to the little room, with the
big brown bed, where she and Emmie had slept,
with the window overlooking the stone-mason's
yard, with the great slabs and blocks of stone.
</p>

<p>
The rain was dripping on the sheds and the
white, unfinished monuments.  Queenie stood for
a long time listening to the soft patter on the
leaves, until she found she was in the Warstdale
granite-quarry, sitting amongst the grey stones,
with Garth stretched on his plaid beside her,
and roused herself with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
She went down after that, and poured out tea
for herself from the little black teapot, and did
justice to Molly's cake; and looked at the grate,
wreathed with sprays of silvery honesty, and
wondered if the rain had cleared up at Hepshaw,
and whether they would go after all to the
abbey; and then scolded herself for being so
stupid and abstracted.
</p>

<p>
Caleb was rather quiet also, and sat regarding
her solemnly through his puffs of smoke; now
and then he seemed about to speak, but checked
himself.  He cleared his throat rather nervously
when Queenie had ended her little repast and
took a seat beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, dear old friend, I am refreshed, and we
can have our talk," she said cheerfully.  "Fill
your pipe again; you never talk so well without
it, you know.  I want to tell you about Emmie,
and the cottage, and the school, and the dear
people at Church-Stile House; if I do not begin
now I shall never get through it all in three
days."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay; but there is something we must
talk about before that; the cottage and the
school were all very well once, but now things
are different.  As I said before, I am not so
young as I was, Miss Queenie, dear; and you
will not flurry me and make me nervous if I tell
you a few of my thoughts?"
</p>

<p>
"Now, Caleb, you are not going to speak
against my little scheme," cried the girl
reproachfully.  "It is all settled; nothing in the world
could shake my purpose.  I would rather be the
school-mistress at Hepshaw, and earn my daily
bread, than be the richest lady in Carlisle."
</p>

<p>
The old man adjusted his pipe with trembling
fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear me, Caleb?"
</p>

<p>
"I hear you, Miss Queenie, my dear."
</p>

<p>
"Do you believe what I say?  When I lie
down at night I am so happy that I cannot
sleep; I can hardly say my prayers sometimes, I
want to sing them instead.  Think of Emmie
and I having our wish, and living in our own
cottage!  Will you come and see us there, dear,
you and Molly?"
</p>

<p>
"No, Miss Queenie; I hope not.  Listen to me,
my dearie.  There, my pipe is out, but never
mind; somehow I can't smoke it to-night.
Supposing you were rich, very rich, Miss
Queenie, how about the cottage then?"
</p>

<p>
"Suppose that you were talking nonsense,"
she returned, laughing.  "Do you know, I have
learnt to make bread, and to cook, and to mend,
and to iron, and to do all sorts of useful things.
I mean my cottage to be the cleanest and the
prettiest in Hepshaw.  There is quite a large
garden, only it was grown over with rank grass;
but Captain Fawcett and Mr. Clayton have had
it dug up.  We mean to plant beans and peas,
and all kinds of vegetables; but I shall have
roses and mignonette under the windows."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, you must listen to me; never mind
about the cottage just now.  What did I say to
you, dearie, about the mysterious dealings of
Providence?  Things happen sometimes that
we never expected.  What were you saying, my
dearie, about being the richest woman in
Carlisle?"
</p>

<p>
The old man's manner was so singular that
the girl gazed at him in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing something strange had happened,
Miss Queenie," he continued nervously, "and
you were to wake up one morning&mdash;this morning,
say&mdash;and find yourself a rich lady, what should
you say to that, my dearie?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I should be sorry, I think.  Oh, Caleb! what
do you mean?" she implored, roused at last
by his agitation.
</p>

<p>
"No, no; don't say that, Miss Queenie, dear;
it is tempting the good Providence that has
turned his hard heart, and made him restore to
you and that precious lamb fourfold of what
was due to you.  'I was sick and ye visited
me.'  There it is, my dearie; and the blessing
has come back to you again when you least
expected it."
</p>

<p>
"Caleb, I cannot bear this," exclaimed the
girl, turning suddenly very pale.  "Do you see
how you are trying me?  Is there something I
ought to know, and that you are trying to
prepare me to hear, something about Mr. Calcott
and Emmie?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay; not about Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"About myself, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay," patting her hand tremulously, "about
yourself, Miss Queenie, dear.  You have woke up
this morning a rich woman.  Mr. Calcott has left
you all his money."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Caleb! no,"&mdash;Queenie's voice rose almost
to a cry&mdash;"not to me, surely, surely!  You must
mean Emmie!  Emmie is his niece, not I; I am
nothing to him."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! but you ministered to him like a
daughter; you were not turned from him by
his hard words."
</p>

<p>
"But I was cruel, and left him alone in his
sufferings; I never came back even to wish him
good-bye.  I have been thinking of myself, not
him, all this time.  Caleb, I can never take his
money, it belongs to Emmie; I can never defraud
Emmie," and Queenie leaned her head on her
old friend's shoulder and burst into a perfect
passion of tears.
</p>

<p>
Caleb stroked her hair gently.  "Hush, my
pretty; there is something like five thousand a
year, all in safe investments.  But the lawyer
will be round here presently, and tell you all
about that.  He has left me an annuity of three
hundred a-year in return for fifty-five years of
faithful services.  Think of that, Miss Queenie!
You might have knocked me down with a feather
when I heard that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but Emmie," she sobbed.  "I cannot
defraud Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"Bless you, Miss Queenie, dear, you are not
defrauding the poor innocent.  If the money had
not come to you it would have gone to some
hospital.  Have you forgotten his vow, that his
sister and her child should never inherit a
farthing of his money?  No doubt he repents
these rash words of his, and he means you to take
care of Emmie, and give her the benefit of his
wealth."
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure, quite sure, that he meant that?"
</p>

<p>
"Positive and certain, my pretty."
</p>

<p>
"And you do not think I shall be wrong to
accept his bounty for her sake?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely not.  It would be quarrelling with the
dispensations of Providence."
</p>

<p>
"I feel so oppressed," cried the girl, laying her
hand on her bosom; "there is a weight here as
though I were sorry and not glad.  If he had
given me a little I could have taken it and have
been thankful, but so much crushes me somehow."
</p>

<p>
"How about the cottage now?" interposed
Caleb jocosely, trying to rally her, but she stopped
him with quivering lips.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  I can bear no more, not to-night.  Did
you say the lawyer was coming?  Let me go away
for a little, I feel sick and giddy, and I want to
understand it all."
</p>

<p>
"Then run away, my dearie, and I will send
for you when he comes; there's a bit of a letter
or a paper that he wants to give you."
</p>

<p>
"She is as cold and white as a bit of marble;
I wonder what's come to the pretty creature," he
muttered when he was left alone.  "She is not
heart glad, I can see that.  She has a scared look
in her face, as though she has lost her foothold
somehow."
</p>

<p>
Queenie had regained her calmness by the time
the lawyer made his appearance.  She listened
to his explanations and instructions silently but
with composure, only her compressed lips and
closely-locked hands showed the intense strain of
feeling under the quietude of her manner.
</p>

<p>
"Five thousand a-year; you are sure that is
the sum mentioned," she said, when he paused
once.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; house property, and investments in the
funds, consols, and various securities will yield
about that sum, I should think.  The furniture is
to be sold, but the plate and valuables are yours.
There are various legacies to old servants, and a
pension or two; but to-morrow we can go over
particularly into details."
</p>

<p>
"And it is all for my own use and benefit?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly so; the terms of the will are binding.
There is to be no partition or deed of gift to
any other person during your lifetime.  There is
a small sealed paper addressed to you, which
Mr. Calcott gave into my hand, and which you had
better read at once, it may throw some light on
his conduct."
</p>

<p>
Queenie took the paper.  It was written in a
feeble, almost illegible, hand, and was not easy to
decipher; the beginning was strangely abrupt.
</p>

<p>
"I have told you that I have no niece; I
must wash my hands of the child.  When a man
has taken an oath upon his lips it is too late then
to talk of repentance.  But I can trust her to
Frank Marriott's daughter.  Mind, girl; I say that
I can trust you, and a dead man's trust is sacred.
</p>

<p>
"My money is my own to do with it as I will.
I have no relation in the world, for the child is
nothing to me.  Do you remember telling me
that you were sorry for me, that no one would
shed tears over my grave?  I can recal your
words now.  'It must be so dreadful not to
want love, to be able to do without it.'  Child,
child, what possessed you to say such words to
me?
</p>

<p>
"Well, you are wrong; Caleb will be sorry for
me, the poor fellow has a faithful heart; and, if I
mistake not, you will shed a tear or two when
you hear that I have gone.  Do you recollect
how you reproached me the first time I saw you?
'Though you were dying of hunger,' you said, 'you
would not crave my bounty.'  You told me that
I had given you hard, sneering words; that I was
refusing to help you in your bitter strait; that I
was leaving you, young and single-handed, to fight
in this cruel world.  Girl, those were hard words
to haunt a dying man's pillow.  Well, well, I am
dying, and I know you have forgiven me, though
I have a wish to hear you say it once; but I
know you forgave me when you gave me that
kiss.  Ah, I have not forgotten that.  I am
leaving you all my money, think of that! to
Frank Marriott's daughter!  It has been a curse
to me, mind you turn it into a blessing.
Remember, I trust the child to you.  Perhaps in the
many mansions,&mdash;but there, Emily was a saint,
and I am a poor miserable sinner.  The child is
like her mother, so take care of her.  If Emily and
I meet&mdash;but there's no knowing&mdash;I should like
to tell her the child has suffered no wrong,&mdash;the
many mansions&mdash;there may be room for Andrew
Calcott; who knows?  There, God bless you; God
bless you both.  I am getting drowsy and must
sleep;" but here the letter broke off abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"I found him exhausted with the effect of
writing," observed Mr. Duncan, turning his head
away that he might not see Queenie's agitated
face; "he made me seal it up in his presence,
and then begged us all to leave him.  In the
morning the nurse found him lying as you have
heard, with his face to the light; he had been
dead some hours.  I was quite struck with the
change in him when I went up; he looked years
younger.  There was a smile on his face, and all
the lines seemed smoothed away.  He had been a
great sufferer all his life, and that made him
something of a misanthrope."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes; no one understood him, and even
I was hard upon him," returned Queenie, bursting
into tears again.  Ah, why had she forgotten
him?  Did she know that the dead hand would
have been stretched out to her with a blessing
in it for her and the child?

CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
QUEENIE'S WHIM.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "She knew not what was lacking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew not until it came;<br>
  She gave it the name of friendship,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was not its name.<br>
  And the truth could not be hidden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her own clear-seeing eyes.<br>
  When the name her own heart whispered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And whispered too, 'Be wise.'"&mdash;<i>Isa Craig-Knox.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The storm had wholly ceased, but a few snatches
of summer lightning still played on the ragged
edge of the clouds when Queenie at last bade
her old friend good night, and went up to her
little room, to think over the bewildering events
of the day.  The air was still oppressed and
sultry.  The white slabs of stone in the mason's
yard shone dimly in the darkness; the wet ivy
scattered a shower of drops on the girl's uncovered
head as she leaned out, as though gasping for
air.  A faint perfume of saturated roses and
drowned lavender pervaded everything.  A
blue-grey moth trailed his draggled wings feebly
across the sill.  The dark-scented air seemed full
of mystery and silence.
</p>

<p>
Queenie leant her head upon her hands and
tried to think, but in reality she was too numb
and bewildered.  "What has happened to me? why
am I more sorry than glad about it all? how
have I deserved it? and what am I to do
with all this wealth that has come to me?" she
kept saying to herself over and over again.
</p>

<p>
A few hundreds would have sent her back
rejoicing and triumphant.  A modest competency,
an assured income, would have lightened the
whole burthen of her responsibility, and made
her young heart happy; but all this wealth!  It
would not be too much to say that for the time
she was simply crushed by it.
</p>

<p>
"Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me
with food convenient to me."  Queenie, as well
as Garth Clayton, had ever loved that prayer of
the wise Agar.  If she could have chosen her lot
in life it would have been in some such words
as these.  To have sufficient, but not too much,
was the very sum and substance of her wishes.
</p>

<p>
Now a strange sense of trouble and loss
oppressed her.  Her plans for the future were
strangely disturbed; a moral earthquake had
shattered her airy castles, and she was looking
mournfully at their wrecks.  Her cottage and
her work, must she relinquish both?  Was
Emmie's childish notion of happiness to be
frustrated also?  "I would rather be the
school-mistress at Hepshaw than the richest lady in
Carlisle."  How passionately she had said those
words, and yet she had meant them from her
very heart.
</p>

<p>
And then, with a sudden sharp pang, she
remembered that it was one of Garth Clayton's
peculiarities to dislike riches for women.  A
certain conversation that had passed between
him and his brother occurred to her with painful
vividness.
</p>

<p>
One of Garth's school friends had just married
a wealthy widow.
</p>

<p>
"What a lucky fellow young Musgrave is,"
Ted had grumbled.  "He was never a fellow for
work, and now he need not do another stroke of
business for the remainder of his life.  See if I
don't pick up a rich wife for myself one of these
days."
</p>

<p>
"What! you would consent to live on your
wife's money!" returned his brother, with a face
of disgust.  "You would help yourself out of
her pocket, in order that you might eat the bread
of idleness! a nice manly notion that."
</p>

<p>
"Why should a man be bound to work for
both if he does not choose?" replied Ted, sulkily.
"I thought this was an enlightened age, and that
the rights of women would entitle them to the
honor of helping to be bread-winner.  Don't
pull such a long face, Garth; I wouldn't marry
any girl if she were weighted in gold unless I
liked her, only I mean to invest my affections
prudently."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I could ever fall in love with a
rich woman," was Garth's emphatic answer.  "I
believe I am peculiar on this point.  If I ever
marry, my wife must be dependent on me, not I
on her.  Why one of the chief pleasures of
matrimony must be to bully your wife sometimes,
just to see how nicely she takes it; but
if she has all the pounds, shillings, and pence on
her side, she might turn round and bully me."
</p>

<p>
"Garth, how can you be so absurd," broke in
Cathy.
</p>

<p>
"You see, a husband ought to have all the
power," he continued, in his droll, half-serious
way.  "The threat of withholding a new dress
would reduce any woman to a state of abject
submission.  I should like my wife, provided I
ever have one, which is not likely if you are
going to be so extravagant, Cathy, I should
like her to coax and wheedle me out of all her
ribbons and fineries; but if she could demand a
cheque for a new silk dress whenever she liked-'I
should thank you to remember, Mr. Clayton,
who it is who brought you all that money'&mdash;why
what a fool I should feel."
</p>

<p>
"Langley, do hear him; when he pays all our
bills without looking at a single item."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but you are not my wife, my dear, that
makes all the difference.  The immaculate
creature whom I honor with my regard must be
made aware that she is marrying a man with a
hobby.  Why," finished Garth, with a sudden
glow of strong feeling on his face, "it must
destroy the very nature and meaning of things
not to feel that your wife is dependent upon you
for everything."
</p>

<p>
How well Queenie recalled this conversation.
How truly it spoke of the nature of the man&mdash;his
sturdy independence, his pride and love of
authority, and also of the tenderness that loved
to shield and protect.
</p>

<p>
Garth always cared most for what was dependent
on him; feminine self-reliance seldom pleased
him.  Queenie's independence was simply owing
to circumstances; she was strong-minded and
yet not self-asserting; her force of will seldom
came to the surface.  In every-day life, amongst
those who loved her, she was singularly submissive
and yielding, and from the first she had
placed implicit trust in Garth Clayton, in a way
that had touched him to the heart.
</p>

<p>
A bitter reflection crossed her mind now&mdash;Garth
was good to her; he had in a way taken
her under his protection, and was showing her
much brotherly kindness; would he not lose
interest in her now she was rich?  Queenie
remembered how coldly he had talked of a certain
school friend of Langley's, a young heiress, who
had lately settled some miles from Hepshaw.
Langley had once or twice proposed driving over
to see her, but Garth had always negatived the
notion.
</p>

<p>
"Caroline is such a good creature," Langley
would say; "she is not pretty, but thoroughly
nice, and so bright."
</p>

<p>
"Then go over, by all means, and see her, my
dear; but I must ask you to excuse me from
accompanying you."  And when Cathy had pressed
him, he had seemed put out, and had muttered,
"that he had something better to do than to run
after girls all day, especially when they were
heiresses."
</p>

<p>
Queenie thought of all this with a certain
dismay and sinking of heart.  She was an heiress
herself, and he disliked heiresses.  Perhaps, when
he knew that, his manner would change; it
would become cooler and more distant.  How
could she ever bring herself to bear that?
</p>

<p>
The thought of the cottage became every
moment dearer.  He was furnishing it for her
now.  He and Langley had been up to the sale,
but the whole business had been kept a secret
from her.
</p>

<p>
"You know you are to leave all these details
to me," he had remarked casually on his return.
Queenie was quite aware how often Cathy and
Langley were closeted with him in his study.
Cathy would come out from these interviews
very round-eyed and mysterious, and with an air
of importance that amused Queenie.  She had a
notion once or twice that the pile of new towels
and dusters in Langley's basket were not for the
use of the inhabitants of Church-Stile House;
but she dared not inquire the truth.
</p>

<p>
Was this pleasant surprise they were planning
to be in vain?  And then again, was she not
bound by her work?  The Vicar and church-wardens
had elected her as mistress of the Hepshaw
girls' school, was she not bound to fulfil
her duties until the vacancy could be filled?
</p>

<p>
Queenie's young head and heart were in a
whirl; regret, pride, pleasure, and yet pain, each
in turn predominated.  "What shall I do? what
ought I to do?" she kept repeating; and then
all at once a look of amusement, almost of glee,
crossed her face.  "I have it! but will it
do? will it be right?  Oh! what will Caleb say?
And then if he, if Mr. Clayton, found out
would he not think it childish and whimsical
to the last degree; but I can't help it, I must
have breathing time and a little happiness first."
</p>

<p>
When Queenie had reached this conclusion
she laid her head on the pillow, but it was not
easy to still her throbbing pulses; for almost the
first time in her healthy young life sleep entirely
forsook her.  The morning sun was flooding the
little chamber, the birds were twittering and
pluming themselves amongst the ivy, before a
brief forgetfulness sealed her senses; a confused
dream followed.  She thought she was standing
on a lonely sand-bank, when suddenly it changed
to shifting gold beneath her feet; she felt herself
sinking, and cried out to some one to save her;
and woke to find Molly's homely face bending
over her, with a great bunch of roses in her
hand.
</p>

<p>
"I have been out to the market, and I bought
these of a poor decent-looking body.  The
master's been down nigh upon an hour, but he
would not let me disturb you before this," cried
Molly, dropping one of her old-fashioned curtseys.
</p>

<p>
Queenie laid her hot cheek against the cool
crimson hearts of the roses.  "Oh, Molly! you
dear, kind creature, how delicious; and how
thankful I am that you woke me.  Do you know,
you have saved me from a horrible death.  I was
drowning in gold, sinking in it; it was all hard
and glittering, and seemed to strangle me.  How
sweet the roses and the sunshine are after it.
Oh!" with a little whimsical shudder, "I wish
I had not woke up such a very rich woman,
Molly."
</p>

<p>
Queenie was in a curious mood all breakfast-time;
she would not talk sensibly, and she
would persist in turning a deaf ear to all Caleb's
scraps of advice and wisdom.  When their frugal
meal was finished she dragged Caleb's great
elbow-chair to the open window, and placed
herself on the low window-seat beside it.  "Now,
Caleb, I want to talk to you," she said coaxingly.
</p>

<p>
"But, Miss Queenie dear, it is getting late,
and you have over-slept yourself, you know;
and there is the office, and Mr. Duncan; he will
be expecting us."
</p>

<p>
"What is the good of being an heiress if one
cannot do as one likes, and keep lawyers and
those sort of people waiting?" returned Queenie,
coolly.  "I am a different person to what I was
yesterday; so different that I have to pinch
myself now and then to be sure that I am really
Queenie Marriott, and not some one else.  I feel
like that man in the 'Arabian Nights' Entertainment,'
only I forget his name."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear young lady," pleaded Caleb,
helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Caleb, you are to be good, and listen
to me.  I am quite serious, quite in earnest; and
if you give me any trouble I shall just take the
next train back to Hepshaw, and leave you and
Mr. Duncan to do as you like with all this
dreadful money."
</p>

<p>
Caleb held up his hands in amazement.
"Dreadful money!" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"It is very rude to repeat people's words,"
replied the girl, with a little stamp of her foot.
"It is dreadful to me; it has been suffocating and
strangling me all night.  I can't be rich all at
once like this, it takes my breath away.  Do you
hear me, Caleb?  I don't mean to be rich for
another twelvemonth."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, what?  I am not as young as I was, and
maybe I am a little hard of hearing, my dearie;"
and Caleb looked at her rather vacantly.
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, dear," she repeated, more
gently, laying her hand on his sleeve to enforce
attention.  "I have been awake all night; the
thought of all this money coming to me unearned
and undeserved oppressed and made me quite
unhappy.  I do not want it," hesitating, and
reddening slightly over her words; "it has
interfered with my plans, and turned everything
in my life topsy-turvy.  It is not that I am
ungrateful, or that I may not want it some day,
but I must be free, free to do my own work,
free to live my own humble life, free as a gipsy
or Bohemian, for one twelvemonth longer."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Queenie, dear, I call this tempting
Providence," began the old man, solemnly.
"These riches are yours, and you must use them.
Why bless your dear heart, they are earned and
deserved over and over again, and every one who
knows you will say so."
</p>

<p>
"These riches are mine, and I suppose I ought
to say thank God for them, and I think I do
in my heart, for Emmie's sake," she replied,
solemnly; "but, Caleb, I am determined for
another year I will not use them.  I will take a
little, perhaps; you and Mr. Duncan shall give
me enough for present use; but for a year I will be
the school-mistress at Hepshaw, and nothing else."
</p>

<p>
"The school-mistress at Hepshaw!&mdash;five thousand
a-year!  Heaven bless us and save us!  I
am getting dazed, Miss Queenie.  The
school-mistress at Hepshaw!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I am bound to my work, and I do not
mean to shrink from it.  I mean to hide up my
riches, to keep them a grand secret even from
Emmie; to live in my little cottage among my
kind friends, and work and be free and happy
for a whole year.  Only one year, Caleb," caressing
him, for tears of disappointment stood in his
eyes; "only one little year out of my whole
life."
</p>

<p>
"And what then, Miss Queenie?"
</p>

<p>
"Then I must be brave, and buckle on my
golden harness.  Don't be afraid, dear old friend,
I do not mean to shrink from my responsibilities;
I would not if they were really and truly to
crush me," with a smile, followed by a sigh.  "I
only want to have time to get used to the
thought.  I must teach and fit myself to be a
rich woman before I am one.  Now you must
promise to keep my secret, you and Molly, and
Mr. Duncan.  No one knows me; no one need
concern themselves about my business.  I was
Miss Titheridge's under-teacher, and now I am
the school-mistress at Hepshaw."
</p>

<p>
"But, Miss Queenie&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Caleb, you must promise me.  Hush," kneeling
down before him, and bringing her bright
face on a level with his; "I will not hear
another word.  It is a whim, dear; just Queenie's
whim, and that is all."
</p>

<p>
"I saw it was a bit of girl's nonsense, but I
couldn't gainsay her coaxing ways," as Caleb said
to Mr. Duncan afterwards.  "She always had a
will of her own, had Miss Queenie; but in the
main she is right and sensible, and has an old
head on young shoulders.  It is just a sort of
play-acting.  She has set her heart on this school
and cottage of hers, and nothing will do for her
but to go back to it."
</p>

<p>
"Marie Antoinette at Trianon!  I have a
notion that there is more in this than meets the
eye," argued the lawyer shrewdly, with a shrug
of his shoulders.  "Well, well, Mr. Runciman,
it is none of our business; the girl is absolute
mistress of her own fortune.  Morton and I are
only joint executors, and bound to see things are
right and fair; she might spend it all on that
charity school of hers, and we should have no
right to interfere."
</p>

<p>
"But, all the same, it is a bit of pure nonsense,"
returned Caleb, distrustful for the first
time of his favorite's good sense.
</p>

<p>
"Don't trouble your head about it, Runciman,"
was the good-humored reply; "the best of
women have their crazy fits sometimes.  Mark
my words, before six months are over she will
have changed her tune.  Either the truth will
have leaked out, or she will be impatient to try
her heiress-ship; there's no knowing what will
happen.  She has asked me for fifty pounds; in
another month it will be a hundred.  Bless you,
when her fingers have got used to the feel of
bank-notes they will slip through them pretty
readily."
</p>

<p>
Queenie had got her way, but she found it
somewhat difficult to pacify her old friend.  She
had just been out to buy some simple unexpensive
mourning for herself and Emmie, and was standing
by the table fingering the stuffs as he
entered.
</p>

<p>
"Silk and crape, that is what you ought to
have worn, Miss Queenie," grumbled Caleb, with a
dissatisfied face; but the girl only shook her head.
</p>

<p>
"Crape is such dusty, inconvenient wear in
the country, and Emmie is such a child," she
returned; "these simple stuffs will be far more
suitable.  Fancy my wearing silk dresses in that
little old barn of a school-room, or in our tiny
cottage!"
</p>

<p>
"This is all of a piece with your fantastical
scheme.  Cambric! why Molly could wear that,"
continued Caleb, with the same rueful visage.
"Dear, dear, what a tempting of Providence,
hoarding and hiding in this miserly way, Miss
Queenie.  Why, as I said to Molly, our young
lady can take one of those big new houses they
are building near us, and have her carriage and
her riding-horse; and no doubt she will visit at
the Deanery, and at Rose Castle, and be an
out-and-out fine lady; but I never thought it would
come to this," dropping his hands on his knees
in a low-spirited way.
</p>

<p>
Queenie laughed, but she could not help an
involuntary shudder at Caleb's picture of her
future greatness.  A house at Carlisle, a carriage,
even prospective visits at the Deanery would be
poor compensation if she must resign her friends
at Hepshaw.  Would not her fortune be productive
of greater happiness, of more enduring
pleasures than those Caleb offered her?  "If I
must be rich I will be rich in my own way,"
thought the girl, a little rebelliously; and all
through that day and the next a thousand
schemes and fancies flitted before her, as
unsubstantial and impracticable as such airy castles
generally prove themselves.
</p>

<p>
A new and perfectly strange feeling of timidity
came over her as the time drew near for her
return to Hepshaw.  Some complicated business
arrangements had compelled her to lengthen her
three days' visit into a week.  Cathy had written
to scold her for her delay; and Queenie had
to ransack her brain to discover plausible
excuses.
</p>

<p>
"Garth has just come in from the works, and
he bids me tell you that you must positively
return on Saturday evening, as the school is to
re-open on Monday," wrote Cathy.  "They are
getting on so nicely at the cottage that it will
be quite ready for occupation in another ten
days; and Langley has discovered a little jewel
of a maid, who will just exactly suit you.  Do
you remember her&mdash;Patience Atkinson, the rosy-faced
girl who lived next door to the wheelwright's?"
</p>

<p>
Cathy's letter, with its girlish overflow of
spirits and affectionate nonsense, caused Queenie
a few moments' uneasiness.  "I shall seem to be
what I am not.  I wonder if I am doing wrong
to deceive them," she thought, with a sudden
throb of startled honesty.  "No; after all, it is
my own business.  I may spend, or hoard, or
fling it all to the winds, and no one would have
a right to complain of me."
</p>

<p>
But, nevertheless, there was a guilty consciousness
that made her for the first time shrink from
meeting Garth Clayton's eye.
</p>

<p>
It was evening when she arrived at Church-Stile
House.  Ted had met her at the station;
Cathy and Emmie had come flying down the
lane to meet them, and had greeted her
rapturously.  As she came across the moat, with the
girls hanging on either arm, she saw Garth at
the hall-door watching them.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what a truant you have been," he said,
in his pleasant way.  "We thought our new
school-mistress had given us the slip.  Cathy had
got all sorts of notions in her head.  One was
that Mr. Calcott had left you a legacy.  She
narrated wonderful dreams to us one morning,
of how you had a great fortune, and were going
to marry a marquis."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy is an inveterate dreamer," returned
Queenie, avoiding Mr. Clayton's eyes as she
spoke.  How constrained her voice was; she
was hot and cold in a moment.  How strange
that he should address her in this manner.  Was
it a presentiment or something?
</p>

<p>
"You are pale and tired; your visit to Carlisle
has not agreed with you," he returned, following
her into the drawing-room, where Langley was
waiting for them.  "It has brought back
unpleasant memories, eh?" with an abruptness,
not unkindly, but which made Queenie still more
nervous.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and I believe I am tired," she stammered.
"Mr. Runciman was very good to me, but he
found it hard to let me go; that worried me
rather; that and other things,"&mdash;the truth
reluctantly drawn from her by those clear grey
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I saw that at once," was the prompt reply,
and then he left her to his sister's care.  But
later on in the evening, when she was rested
and refreshed, he returned again to the
charge.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose Mr. Calcott has left a great deal of
money?  I did not read in the paper at what
amount his property was valued, but I suppose
it was pretty considerable."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I believe so," returned Queenie faintly.
They were sitting round the open window; the
lamp on the centre table cast only a dim light
on their faces.  Langley had been playing to
them, and just now the music had ceased.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any idea how he has disposed of
it?  Every one thought there would be a new
wing added to the hospital.  He had not a
relative in the world belonging to him, except
your little sister Emmie."
</p>

<p>
"No; and he has left nothing to Emmie," she
returned, thankful that in this she could speak
the whole truth.  "Nearly all of it has gone to
a stranger, a mere connection.  Caleb has an
annuity; and I&mdash;he has not forgotten me,"
shielding her face still more in the darkness.
"Emmie and I will have enough to live on now.
I shall not need to give French lessons, or to add
in any way to my salary," blurting out the lesson
she had prepared herself to say.
</p>

<p>
"Will you have enough without the school?"
persisted Garth curiously.  His keen ear had
detected a certain trembling in Queenie's voice.
Her agitation had not escaped him, and he was
trying in his straightforward way to find out
why she was not like herself to-night.  "Do you
mean that your salary is no longer of importance
to you?"
</p>

<p>
"It is not all that we shall have to live on,
that is what I meant to say," she returned
hurriedly.  "I shall not have to stint, or be
afraid of how we shall make ends meet; there
will be enough.  Emmie will have little comforts;
that is all I care for."
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad," returned Garth, gravely;
but he questioned her no more.  Possibly he
expected her further confidence, and was a little
disappointed when she withheld it.  Neither on
that evening nor on any further occasion did he
revert to the subject; and Queenie, who began
to feel her position an embarrassing one, was glad
that the whole matter should be consigned to
oblivion.
</p>

<p>
Cathy's curiosity was much more easily
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"There, my dream has come true," she said,
embracing her ecstatically when they had retired
to their own rooms.  "Why did you not write
and tell me about it?  Will you have much,
Queen&mdash;a whole hundred a-year?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I shall have a hundred a-year," returned
Queenie, trying not to laugh.  When she was
away from those keen grey eyes she felt
something like a renewal of courage.  Her spirits
returned; the whole thing appeared to her in the
light of a good joke.  "When it comes out, and
he asks me the reason of this mystery, I know
what I shall tell him," she thought, when Cathy
had withdrawn, well pleased, and she was left
alone for the night.  "I shall tell him that I
wanted to remain poor a little longer, and to be
liked for myself; that I feared losing the school
and the cottage; that it was an innocent whim
that could do no one harm, and that would give
me a great deal of pleasure," and when she had
settled this point comfortably with herself she
composed herself to sleep.

CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
WEAVING IN THE SUNSET.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where waitest thou,<br>
  Lady I am to love?  Thou comest not;<br>
  Thou knowest of my sad and lonely lot;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look'd for thee ere now!<br>
</p>

<p class="intro2">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is the May!<br>
  And each sweet sister soul hath found its brother;<br>
  Only we two seek fondly each the other,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, seeking, still delay."&mdash;<i>Arnold.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Queenie entered upon her new duties with an
ardor that would have surprised any one
acquainted with the real state of the case.  If a
feeling of amusement sometimes crossed her
mind at the incongruity between her present
position and the heiress-ship she had refused to
take up, it only added zest and flavor to her
work.
</p>

<p>
Queenie Marriott was one of those women
whose zeal was according to knowledge.  She
loved her work for its own sake.  In her eyes it
was invested with a meaning and dignity that
redeemed it from its so-called drudgery, and placed
it high in the ranks of honorable labor.
</p>

<p>
Her youthful enthusiasm anointed everything
with a sort of moral chrism.  The little barnlike
structure, with its half-moon windows, and rough
forms and desks, was a species of temple wherein
she enshrined all manner of precious things.
When she looked round on the children's faces
they seemed to appeal to her with all sorts of
involved meanings, demanding patience and
sympathy, and all such goodly things at her hands.
</p>

<p>
Queenie knew the royal road to learning lay
through her pupils' hearts.  She must love them,
and teach them to love her; obedience would
follow as a matter of course.  All children were
dear to her, for Emmie's sake.  Now and then,
through the buzz of voices droning through the
repetition lessons, there would come before her a
certain vivid memory, stabbing her with sudden,
sharp pain&mdash;a dark garret haunted with shadows;
a pale-faced child crouched on the window-seat,
wrapped in an old red shawl, with great blue
eyes dim with fear; of a little figure stricken
down, and lying amongst them as one that was
dead; of a sick-room where a child-martyr went
down into the very valley of the shadow of
death, where a fight so long and terrible was
carried on that the weary watcher only covered
her face with her trembling hands, and prayed
for merciful death to come as a deliverer.
</p>

<p>
And so for the sake of that childish sufferer,
and that great miracle of healing&mdash;Queenie clave
with very love to all children.  There was one
child, Prissy Atkinson, the sister of the very
Patience whom Langley had selected as her little
maid, to whom she showed especial kindness.
</p>

<p>
She was the plainest and most uninteresting
girl in the school, slightly lame, and with an odd
drawl and lisp in her voice, ungainly in manner,
and with no particular cleverness to recommend
her; yet, by some undefinable feeling, Queenie
singled out this child as an object of her interest.
</p>

<p>
The little rough head often felt a tender hand
laid upon it.  The gentlest voice Prissy had ever
heard would accost her now and then; difficult
tasks were smoothed by magic; pleasant smiles
would reward her diligence.  When her head once
ached, a resting-place was found for it on teacher's
own shoulder.  "Oh, teacher!  I love you!  I do
love you so!" cried Prissy, out of the fulness of
her heart, throwing her thin arms round Queenie's
neck.  Was the warm kiss that answered her
given in reality to Prissy or to Emmie?
</p>

<p>
Emmie would come sometimes and look in at
the open door, with round blue eyes, very wide
open with pleasure and astonishment.  The little
girls would look up from their tasks and nod at
her; the sisters would interchange fond, satisfied
looks.  Sometimes a tall figure would pause for
a moment behind Emmie; then a strong arm
would draw the child from the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Naughty Emmie! infringing the rules in
school-hours.  Do you know I shall have you
put on a form as an example for disobedient
children?  Why has Langley allowed you to
play truant in this way?"
</p>

<p>
"I ran away from Cathy, down the lane,"
Emmie answered, clinging to his hand, and looking
up coaxingly into his face.  "I do love to
see Queenie amongst them all.  Did she not look
nice, Mr. Clayton?"
</p>

<p>
"Very nice," returned Garth absently.  In
reality he was pondering over the little scene he
had just witnessed.  "It would make a picture,"
he thought; "the slim, girlish figure in the black
dress, the bent brown head, the children's eager
faces, the bowl of white narcissus on the desk,
the sunshine streaming in at the open door."  She
had looked up at him, and smiled as he stood
there, such a bright smile; somehow it haunted
him.  "What a brave, true heart it is," he
thought, as he went down the village with Emmie
still clinging closely to him.  "She looked as
proud of herself and her work as ever Princess
Ida amongst her golden-haired girl-graduates.
That is what I like about her; she is superior to
the nonsense and conventionality of the present
day.  Most women would have felt themselves
humiliated in her position; but she seems to
have grasped the real meaning of her work and
purpose.  If it were not selfish I could find it in
my heart to be half sorry about that legacy.  I
wanted to see if the bare crust she talked about
would have set her teeth on edge in the eating.
I had a notion that it would have been pleasant
to see her working up her way alone; and then
one would have a faint chance of helping her.
She is beyond this now; Cathy says he has
left her a hundred a-year.  Why, with her salary
and what she has they will have close upon two
hundred.  They will do capitally on that; and,
after all, one would not like to see them pinch.
Well, it is none of my business," finished Garth,
rousing himself from his cogitations.  "I wish
Dora could have seen her just now, giving that
object lesson; I fancy she would have changed
her opinion altogether.  How strange it was that
they did not seem to take to each other; but
then women are strange creatures, and difficult
to understand."
</p>

<p>
It was an odd coincidence that made Garth
think of Dora; for at that moment her little
pony-carriage turned the corner of the lane.  She
waved her whip and her little gloved hand as
she saw him; and Garth crossed the road with
a slight flush on his face.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to see Miss Marriott.  I promised
to call upon her; but I find the cottage is still
unoccupied," said Miss Cunningham, leaning a
little towards him, and fixing her calm blue eyes
on his face.  Not a look or gesture escaped her
scrutiny.  His slight confusion at her unexpected
appearance was perfectly transparent to her.
"Things are going on as they ought to go on,"
she said to herself; "but there is no need to
hurry it;" and though her pulses quickened a
little at his obvious pleasure at seeing her she
would have scorned to betray her interest.
</p>

<p>
"They do not go in until Tuesday; we shall
keep them until then," returned Garth, stroking
the pony's neck absently.  Dora was looking
prettier than ever this morning, he thought.  She
wore a hat with a long, white curling feather;
the golden hair shone under it; she patted it
nonchalantly with her little gloved hand as she
talked.  Emmie interrupted them presently.
</p>

<p>
"School is over! there are the girls coming
out.  Prissy is last, of course.  Ah! there is
Queenie!" and she darted across the road, and
almost threw herself on her sister.  Queenie did
not quicken her steps when she saw them.  She
came up a little reluctantly when she recognized
the occupant of the pony-carriage.
</p>

<p>
Dora greeted her with her usual good-humor.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there you are, Miss Marriott! how cool
you look in that nice, broad-brimmed hat.  But
I am sorry to see you in black.  You have lost a
friend, Mr. Clayton tells me.  Well, I told you
that I should call and have a chat about the
school and all manner of things.  Will you jump
in and let me drive you up the lane.  Langley
has promised me some luncheon."
</p>

<p>
"Emmie and I will be at the house as soon as
you," returned Queenie, taking the child's hand
and walking on swiftly.  Miss Cunningham
meant to be kind, she was sure of that; why
was it that her manner always irritated her?
There was a flavor of patronage in it that galled
her sensitiveness.  "Perhaps if she knew I had
five thousand a-year she might change her tone,"
thought Queenie, a little wrathfully.  "I never
find it difficult to get on with people; and
yet in my heart I cannot like her.  Why
will she make it her business to poach on other
people's manor?  The Hepshaw school is my
affair, and has nothing to do with Crossbill
Vicarage."
</p>

<p>
Miss Cunningham seemed to think otherwise.
She cross-examined Queenie all through luncheon
on a hundred petty details.  Queenie, to her
surprise, found she was acquainted with many of
the girls' names and histories.  She put the new
mistress right on one or two points with much
shrewdness and cleverness.  She could talk, and
talk well, on most subjects.  By-and-bye, when
the school was exhausted, she turned to Garth,
and argued quite a knotty point of politics with
him, elucidating her view with a clear-headedness
and force of words that surprised her
feminine hearers.
</p>

<p>
Garth had much ado to hold his own against
her, but the consciousness of being in the right
gave him the advantage.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Miss Dora, I think you must yield this
once," he said, looking at her triumphantly.
Dora measured him with her glance before she
answered.
</p>

<p>
"I never yield to papa, but I suppose I must
to you," she said in the quietest manner possible,
and there was a slight stress on the last word
that made Garth redden as though he had
received an unexpected concession.
</p>

<p>
He placed himself at her side when they went
into the garden after luncheon, and appeared
determined to monopolize her attention; but this
did not seem to suit Miss Cunningham, for she
called Cathy to her, and the two commenced a
conversation in which he soon found himself
excluded.  Once or twice, when he turned restive
under this treatment, and seemed to incline to
seek conversation in a little talk with Queenie,
a soft glance from Dora's blue eyes recalled and
kept him stationary.
</p>

<p>
"All this is so uninteresting to you gentlemen,
you like politics better," she said presently in a
low voice, as though appealing for pardon; "if
you will gather me a few flowers, Mr. Clayton, I
shall soon have finished my talk with Cathy, and
then we will take a turn down the plane-tree
walk; it looks so cool and shady."  But when the
flowers were tastefully arranged, and Garth, with
a little look of triumph, threw open the gate for
her to pass through, Dora still held Cathy's arm.
It was not quite as enjoyable as Garth had
fancied it would be.  Dora was all amiability and
sweetness; she had the roses in her hands, and
touched them tenderly from time to time.  She
tripped beside him, holding up her long white
dress with one hand, the other rested lightly on
Cathy's arm.  Her blue eyes looked yearningly
at him and the sunset together.
</p>

<p>
"How calm and still everything looks.  I think
I love this old walk better than any place in the
world.  It reminds me of old days, Mr. Clayton,
when you and I and Cathy used to walk here."
</p>

<p>
"When we were children we used to say that
two were company and three none," responded
Garth sulkily.  The hint was so obvious that
Cathy would at once have made her escape, but
Dora tightened her grasp on her arm with a
slightly heightened color.
</p>

<p>
"That depends on one's company.  One could
never find Cathy in the way," she said, with a
little infusion of tenderness in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Never! can you imagine no possible circumstances
in which a duet would be preferable?"
questioned Garth, turning on her so abruptly that
Dora, for all her coolness, was non-plussed for the
moment.  What was he going to say?  With all
her prudence she felt alarmed and fluttered, but
the thought of her girls calmed her into
soberness again.
</p>

<p>
"I never was good at guessing riddles," she
returned, not perusing the gravel at her feet as
some girls would have done in her place, but
looking full at him with unblenching eyes.  "Just
now a trio suits me best, that is all I meant."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw," he muttered, turning angrily away.
Was she fooling him after all?  He was not a man
who would ever understand coquetry or caprice;
such things would have simply disgusted him;
but then he knew Dora was no coquette.  "She
is trying to manage me for some purpose of her
own; she wants me to come to a certain point
and no further; she is showing me very plainly
what she means," he said to himself, repulsed
and yet attracted in spite of himself by this
strange conduct.  After all the plane-tree walk
and the sunset, now he had them, were failures.
He had not once this evening called her Dora.
How could he, with Cathy walking there beside
them, and noting his discomfiture with her keen
girlish eyes.  True, he had not known what he
would have said to her if they had been alone;
sentiment was only just waking up in Garth's
nature.  A week or two ago he would have
pronounced himself heart-whole, would have laughed
at the notion of his being in love.  Why had a
sudden fancy come to him for golden hair and
sunsets, and quiet evening strolls?  Was he feeling
dimly after something? was this restlessness,
this indefinable longing after some visionary
ideal, a part of the disease?
</p>

<p>
Garth could not have answered these questions
if his life depended on it.  He had ceased to be
satisfied with his sister's company.  A craving
after some new excitement made itself very
plainly felt at this time.  His pulses were
throbbing with fresh life; the world was before him,
the young man's world; he had only to look
round him and choose.  Strong, keen-eyed,
vigorous, with dominant will and sober judgment,
what obstacle need he dread? what impediments
could he not overcome?
</p>

<p>
Hitherto freedom, and the mystery obscuring
his future fate, had had a strange charm in Garth's
eyes.  It had pleased him to know that such
things were for him when he should stoop and
open his hand to receive the best gift of heaven.
"I suppose I shall fall in love some day, every
one does; but there is plenty of time for that sort
of thing," he often said to his sisters, and there
had been an amused look upon his face, as though
the notion pleased him.
</p>

<p>
But, in spite of his young man's conceit, Garth
had an old-fashioned reverence in speaking on
such subjects.  It would not be too much to say
that he stood, as it were, bare-headed on holy
ground.  One evening, shortly after Queenie's
return from Carlisle, Cathy had been repeating
to them scraps of poetry as they sat round the
open window in the twilight, and by-and-bye
she commenced in a low voice reciting some
quaint old lines of Arnold, in which this
craving for an unknown love is most touchingly
depicted.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thou art as I&mdash;<br>
  Thy soul doth wait for mine, as mine for thee;<br>
  We cannot live apart must meeting be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never before we die?<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear soul, not so!<br>
  That time doth keep for us some happy years,<br>
  That God hath portion'd out our smiles and tears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou knowest, and I know.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yes, we shall meet!<br>
  And therefore let our searching be the stronger:<br>
  Dark days of life shall not divide us longer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor doubt, nor danger, sweet!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Therefore I bear<br>
  This winter-tide as bravely as I may,<br>
  Patiently waiting for the bright spring-day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cometh with thee, dear."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"How beautiful!" sighed Langley.  "I have
always been so fond of those lines.  Your new song,
'My Queen.' embodies the same meaning, Cathy."  But
Garth said nothing; he only sat for a long
time shading his eyes with his hand, and there
was a certain moved look on his face when he
uncovered it as though he had been strongly affected.
</p>

<p>
But ever since that evening the restlessness
had grown upon him, and there had been a certain
carping fastidiousness in his manner to his
sisters; and once or twice he had used Dora's
name as a sort of reproach.  "If you were only
as good a manager as Miss Cunningham, Langley;"
or "I wish you would read more, and choose your
books as sensibly as Miss Dora does, Cathy."
</p>

<p>
Langley took her rebuke meekly and in silence;
but Cathy treated her brother to a contemptuous
shrug and a disdainful look.
</p>

<p>
"Dora; I am sick of Dora.  Every one sees how
that will end," she said in a vexed voice, when
they had come in from the garden, and she had
followed her friend up-stairs.  "When that
happens I suppose we shall all be managed into our
graves."
</p>

<p>
"Oh don't!" exclaimed Queenie, with a
sudden accent of pain, and becoming somewhat
pale over her words.  "She is not good enough
for him&mdash;for your brother."
</p>

<p>
"She is too good, you mean.  I hate such
faultless people.  Dora is never in the wrong;
she is a pattern daughter, a pattern sister, a
model housekeeper, and unexceptionable in all
parochial and social duties; the work she gets
through would astonish your weak mind."
</p>

<p>
"And then she is so clever."
</p>

<p>
"Clever! she is a perfect paragon of learning.
She educated her sisters until they went to
Brussels.  Then she is no mean musician; she
works beautifully too, and copies out all her
father's sermons.  I am not sure she does not
write them as well."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! now I can see you are joking."
</p>

<p>
"My dear, Dora is no joking matter, I can
assure you; she and her goodness together are
very ponderous affairs.  Do you think Garth
does not know all this?  Why he and Dora have
been friends ever since they were children."
</p>

<p>
"I can see that he respects her most
thoroughly."
</p>

<p>
"Not more than she respects him; she is
always telling how excellent he is, and what a
model to other young men.  When I am in a
very good humor with Garth, I sometimes
repeat these little speeches, only I have come
lately to doubt the wisdom of adding fuel to
the fire."
</p>

<p>
"Surely such perfection must satisfy you as
well as him, or you must be difficult to please,"
returned Queenie a little sarcastically.  A numb,
undefinable sort of pain seemed taking
possession of her.  Would Hepshaw be quite so
desirable a place of residence when Dora was
mistress of Church-Stile House? this was the
question she asked herself.  And for the first
time the thought of her fortune gave her a
positive feeling of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as to that, I am very fond of Dora,"
replied Cathy carelessly; "she amuses me, and
she is very good-natured; and then one must
like one's future sister-in-law for the sake of dear
old Garth.  I only hope she will have the good
sense not to try and manage him, for he will
never stand it."
</p>

<p>
This conversation depressed Queenie somehow,
and kept her wakeful and restless; it did not add
to her tranquillity to hear Garth's footsteps under
her window, crunching the gravel walk, for
long after they had retired.  It was contrary to
his usual habit; it argued disturbance or
preoccupation of mind.
</p>

<p>
Garth's soliloquy would have perplexed both
her and Cathy if they had heard it.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if I am in love with Dora after
all?" he was asking himself, as he lighted
himself a fresh cigar, and then stood leaning against
the little gate, looking down the plane-tree walk.
It was moonlight now, and the monuments
glimmered in the white light; there were faint,
eerie shadows under the dark trees; now and
then a night-bird called, or a dog barked from
the village, and then stillness gathered over
everything again.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if I am really in love, or if I am
only arguing myself into it.  Now I come to
think of it, when I imagined my future wife I
always thought of Dora; we have grown up
together, and it seems natural somehow; and
then I had always a boyish fancy for golden hair.
What a pretty little head it is, as well as a wise
one.  I wish she were not quite so independent,
and would lean on a fellow more.  I suppose it
is the fault of circumstances.  Every one depends
on her&mdash;her father and her sisters.  She never
had the chance of being helpless like other women.
I always think of that and make allowance for
her faults.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes," soliloquized the young philosopher
as his cigar went out, and he calmly
relighted it, "sometimes I'm afraid that if we
ever came together I might find her a little
masterful and opinionated; that is the danger
with capable women, they have their own
notions and stick to them.  I confess I should
like my wife to follow my ideas, and not to be
lady paramount in everything; not that even
Dora would find it easy to manage me,"
continued Garth, with an amused curl of the lip.
</p>

<p>
"What a nice, sensible little companion she
would be for a man," he resumed presently, after
the firm even footsteps had crunched the gravel
awhile.  "That is the best of her, she never
bores or wearies one; she is always fresh and
good-humored, and ready to take interest in
everything, even in the schools, and Miss
Marriott, only Miss Marriott repulses her
somehow.  Her manner vexed me this afternoon;
there was a stand-offishness and a reserve in it,
as though Dora's interest offended her.  She
never appears at her best advantage when Dora
is with us.  Why am I always comparing those
two? somehow I can't help it.  Dora interests me
most, of course; and yet men who are in love
seldom study the pros and cons of character as I
have been doing for the last half-hour.  Certainly
some of the symptoms are still lacking, or else I
am too matter-of-fact a fellow to have them.
And yet I don't know.  What were those lines
Cathy repeated the other night?  How well the
little puss recited them; with such feeling too.

Humph!  I am not in love so much as all that,
and I don't think Dora is either.  I have a

lady I am to love?'  Well, it is a rare old poem,
and touches a fellow up in an extraordinary

it haunts me to a droll extent.  There, my cigar

CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
THE MISTRESS OF BRIERWOOD COTTAGE.

<p class="intro2">
  "By night we lingered on the lawn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For underfoot the herb was dry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And genial warmth; and o'er the sky<br>
  The silvery haze of summer dawn;<br>
</p>

<p class="intro2">
  "And calm that let the tapers burn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unwavering: not a cricket chirr'd:<br>

<p>
"A penny for your thoughts, little Emmie,"
cried Garth gaily, a few evenings afterwards,
when his abrupt entrance had broken up a somewhat
silent group.  The child, who was sitting at
Langley's feet as usual, with her head in her lap,
held up her hand warningly.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  I was counting them; now I have
lost one."
</p>

<p>
"Counting what, you small elf?"
</p>

<p>
"The angels, of course; we have had ever so
many passing through the room this evening.
Just now Langley sighed and disturbed one.
They never come when we talk and laugh, you
know," continued Emmie, with a child's beautiful
unreasoning faith in what would seem to older
minds a piece of fond superstition.  "I do love
a real long silence, when people are all thinking
together; the angels have such a good time of it
then."
</p>

<p>
"What a queer little thinking machine that
is," muttered Ted, drowsily; but Garth only
patted her head kindly.
</p>

<p>
It was never his way to laugh at a child's
fancies.  "The real germ is hidden in the bud;
a mere infant will sometimes turn our wisdom
into foolishness," he had observed more than
once in his graver moments.  "Well, my white
May-flower," he continued, using his pet name
for her; "so the angels were having it all to
themselves this evening, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I did not know we were assisting at a <i>séance</i>,"
growled Ted, stretching himself; "we have got a
precious small medium, it strikes me.  What sort
of spirits were they, Emmie, black, white, or
grey?  I fancied my own familiar, in the shape
of an elongated cat, with yellow sparks for eyes,
grinned at me with feline and whiskered face
from behind the sofa corner.  'Avaunt thee,
witch,' I cried, and with diabolic stare and hiss
it vanished."
</p>

<p>
"A truce with your nonsense, Ted; you will
scare the child."
</p>

<p>
"I think we have all been very stupid and
silent this evening," interposed Langley.  "I fancy
that we are all sorry to lose Queenie and Emmie
from our circle to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"The sofa-cushion is drenched with my tears,"
continued Ted, the incorrigible.  "The drip, drip
of them was mistaken by Langley for rain.  'A
wet evening,' quoth she; but my sobs prevented
me from undeceiving her."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't Mr. Ted wicked to tell so many stories
in play?" interrupted Emmie, in a shocked
tone.
</p>

<p>
"Play!" reiterated that remorseless youth,
"is that how you stigmatize an honest grief, and
mistaken though blighted devotion? is it
nothing to this lacerated heart to know that the
beloved heads of the Marriott sisters will rest for
the last time to-night beneath our roof?  'Quoth
the raven, nevermore, rests sweet Marriott at thy
door.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shut up, you young idiot," exclaimed his
brother in a tone of deep disgust.
</p>

<p>
"He has been so tiresome all day," observed
Cathy; "he has not left Queenie and me a
moment in peace."
</p>

<p>
"Only a lock of hair, and that was refused;
even a hair-pin would have been prized, or the
frayed end of a ribbon; all, all denied.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh stay, the Clayton said; and yield<br>
  A withered rose, or weed of field.<br>
  Indignant glared her bright brown eye,<br>
  And with a frown she made reply,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You botherer.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Ted, in another moment&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You have the heart of a barbarian, Garth;
the softer passion is unknown to you&mdash;the 'pills
and paradise' of a man's existence.  Look at me,
like Etna half consumed, a mighty ruin&mdash;all thy
work, oh woman!  Ah, as the soothing bard,
the glorious Will of immortal memory, once
wrote&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'He never told his love; no, never;<br>
  No more did she, but did you ever'&mdash;<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
She gave him one long glance, and then"&mdash;but
Ted never finished his ridiculous effusion, for in
another moment Garth had pinned him in his
powerful grasp, and stretched him prone and
struggling on the floor.  "And there shall you
lie until you have promised not to spout any
more nonsense," was the inexorable mandate of
his tyrant.
</p>

<p>
"Floored by fate, and crushed by the gigantic
hoof of destiny, I submit.  'More kicks than
half-pence,' quoth he, under the healing (heeling)
process; but what boots such trifles to the
stalwart heart of a young Briton.  Alas, thy
sole is open and clear to me, my brother, and
the footprint of ignoble passion is stamped
upon it."
</p>

<p>
"Pax, pax," groaned Garth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, leave him alone, you are only making
him worse," laughed Queenie; "if he sees nobody
heeds his nonsense he will soon leave off."
</p>

<p>
"I feel like the gladiator, butchered to make
a Clayton holiday; my breast-bone is staved in
by the barbarian.  'Dying, we salute thee,
Caesar.'  Well, it is of 'no consequence,' as Toots
remarks."
</p>

<p>
"There, get up and behave yourself," interrupted
Garth, with a final kick; "and now, to
get rid of this foolish fellow, I vote that some of
us take a turn in the plane-tree walk.  Come,
Miss Marriott, you and Cathy put on your
hats."  But Cathy, who was in a curious mood
to-night, and had done nothing but sigh and
interlace her fingers restlessly in the twilight,
muttered something about Miss Cosie and the
Vicarage, and vanished from the room; and so
it came to pass that Queenie found herself
gravely pacing up and down the plane-tree walk
by Garth's side.
</p>

<p>
Naturally as it had come about&mdash;for no one
else had volunteered to accompany them&mdash;the
novelty of the circumstance caused them both a
little embarrassment; and, by some curious
physiological coincidence, each fell to thinking
of Dora Cunningham.  Garth smoked his cigar
meditatively, and cast curious side-long glances
at the slender black figure beside him.  Visions
of a white dress and golden hair still haunted
him.  Why was he shy and silent all at once? had
he anything in common with this grave,
brown-eyed girl?  He was wondering, if she were
Dora would he have found anything to say to
her?  He was sorry to think that this was Miss
Marriott's last night.  Sorry! yes; it made him
feel all at once as though the old house had
grown suddenly dull and empty; and yet if it
had been Dora&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Miss Marriott, how is it that you and Miss
Cunningham don't hit it off better?" he said,
so abruptly that Queenie started and changed
color.  She was feeling very heavy-hearted, poor
little soul, to think it was her last night at
Church-Stile House; and how she would miss
the slow, even tramp of Garth's footsteps under
her windows, and the red end of his cigar
emerging from the trees every ten minutes.
She had often sat and watched it with
unconscious interest even to herself; she was
loath to part with that, and his cheery good
morning when she looked out to smell the
roses.
</p>

<p>
She was just wondering how much he would
miss her, and whether her absence would leave
any perceptible gap in the family circle; and
this question jarred upon her with sudden
discord.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she asked faintly,
conscious all at once of a certain chilliness round
the region of the heart.  She had hoped for a
few words of friendly interest and advice on her
own affairs to-night.  Had he only brought her
out there to talk of Dora Cunningham?
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you two girls get on better
together?" pursued Garth, inexorably.  He was
quite aware of the reluctance of Queenie's tone
as she answered him, but the opportunity was a
good one, and he thought he would have it out
with her.  She was indebted to him for much
kindness, he told himself; his sisters and he had
taken her by the hand, and found her occupation,
and a roof to cover her head; he had a right to
ask, as a return, that she should show a little
consideration for him and his friends; and her
manner to Dora somehow galled him.  Perhaps
he was a little curious on the subject as well;
anyway, he would have his answer.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know that we do not?" she
replied, fencing in her turn.  "I have not seen
Miss Cunningham more than three or four times;
we are comparative strangers to each other."
</p>

<p>
"You know her as well as you know Mrs. Fawcett
or Miss Faith Palmer; they are all
comparative strangers to you, but to them your
manner is always so bright and genial."
</p>

<p>
"Ah; one cannot help getting on with them."
</p>

<p>
"I should have said the same of Miss Cunningham.
There, you shake your head; how impossible
it is to understand you women.  Miss Dora
seems so willing to be friendly on her side.  She
has driven over twice to see you, and tender her
advice and help; but one cannot help seeing how
these overtures have been repelled."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clayton, pray don't speak as though you
were hurt with me."
</p>

<p>
"I do feel a little hurt about this," he replied,
gravely; "at least it disappoints me.  You
see Dora, I mean Miss Cunningham, has been
intimate with us ever since we were children
together, and we think so much of her opinion in
things.  When you came among us, and decided
on taking up this new work, I thought at once
what a valuable friend you would secure in her."
</p>

<p>
"You were very kind," stammered poor
Queenie with downcast eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Confess that my kindness was thrown away
though," he continued in a lighter tone, for her
distress was not lost on him.  "You are such an
iceberg in her presence that even her good nature
has failed to thaw you.  You are never proud
with Langley or Cathy, and yet Cathy can say
rude things sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"I am never proud with those I love."
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't mean to love Miss Cunningham."
</p>

<p>
"No," reluctantly; "but I do not dislike her.
There is simply no sympathy between us, and her
manner jars and irritates me somehow.  It seems
as though, she were trying to keep me down in
my place, and make me remember that I am
only the poor school-mistress in Hepshaw, when,
when you all try to make me forget it," continued
the girl, and now the tears rushed to her eyes.
Garth had never seen her so moved, but her
frankness did not displease him.  It might be
his duty to give her a little wholesome advice,
and to bid her curb that troublesome pride of
hers; but, on the whole, he felt sorry for her.
</p>

<p>
"I think we ought to be very patient with a
person that displeases us, and ask ourselves
whether the fault may not lie on our side,"
continued her young Mentor gravely.  He rather
liked the right he had assumed of lecturing this
girl; the occupation was piquant and interesting,
and then she took his rebukes so meekly.  "Miss
Cunningham is a very superior person, you cannot
fail to own that, I am sure; so many people
rely upon her.  She is the mainstay at home;
her father's right hand in every thing; and then
her sisters idolize her.  She must be truly
lovable, or they would not be so fond of her."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clayton, what does it matter whether
we get on together or not?" exclaimed Queenie
at this point, stung by all this praise, and sore
almost to unhappiness.  "It cannot matter to
her, or to you either, whether I like her or not."
</p>

<p>
"It matters a good deal to me whether my
friends are appreciated.  I am disappointed
about it, because I wanted to secure you a
valuable ally, that is all; but I suppose it cannot
be helped.  Women are unaccountable beings; it
is best, after all, to leave them alone," and Garth's
voice was so full of kindness and regret that
Queenie's soreness vanished in a sudden effort of
magnanimity.
</p>

<p>
"I dare say it was my fault; I am sure Miss
Cunningham meant to be kind," she faltered out
hurriedly.  "Only when one is poor, one is
proud and sensitive over little things.  Don't say
anything more about it, Mr. Clayton; I mean to
like her.  I will like her, and you shall not have
reason to complain of my disagreeable manner
again."
</p>

<p>
"No; not disagreeable, only cold," he returned,
with a smile of genuine content, for this admission
pleased him well.  They had stopped simultaneously
at the little gate, and Queenie made a
movement as though to go in, but he would not
suffer it.  "No; you shall not leave me in this way,
we will have another turn," he said cheerfully.
"Let us talk of something else&mdash;of yourself and
your plans.  Do you know, I feel quite dull at
the thought of losing you and Emmie to-morrow.
I wonder how much you intend to miss us."
</p>

<p>
"More than I ever missed any one in my
whole life before," was the answer on Queenie's
lips, but she prudently forbore to utter it, as she
moved again by his side in the darkness.  Did
no warning monitor within her whisper that this
man was growing dangerously dear to her; that
the snare was already spread for her unconscious
feet?
</p>

<p>
"He means to marry Dora; but I have a right
to claim him still as my friend.  No one shall
steal his friendship from me.  I will have what
belongs to me," she had said to herself, almost
fiercely; but the falseness of the sophistry was
glossed over and hidden from her eyes.  For the
last few days a great sadness had crept over her.
Since the evening Dora had passed through the
little gate, and had walked with him up and
down in the sunset, some visionary hope, baseless
and unsubstantial as a dream, had vanished from
her heart.
</p>

<p>
Of what avail was her idle whim now?  Would
it not have been better, so she told herself, to
have shaken off the dust of Hepshaw from her
feet?  Whose blame was it if she had tangled
her own life?  Some impulse, some undefinable
influence, had drawn her to weave these strange
plans of hers; more than a girl's fancy and love
of mystery and adventure were wrapped up in
them.  But might it not be that bitter failure
and remorse should be her portion hereafter?
</p>

<p>
Would there not have been greater peace
and safety for her in that house in Carlisle?
Queenie asked herself these questions with a sigh
long after she had left Garth, and retired to her
own room, where Emmie was slumbering peacefully.
She kissed the child, and placed herself
under the shadow of the window-curtain, and
watched, for the last time, the tiny red spark
emerging every now and then from under the
trees.
</p>

<p>
"Miss him! he little knows how I shall miss
him!" she said to herself, bitterly.  "Right or
wrong, he has got into my life, and I cannot get
him out.  Does he love Dora, I wonder?  I
cannot make up my mind; but he will marry her,
for all that; and then, then, if I find it very
hard to bear, if she will not let me keep him as
a friend, we will go away, Emmie and I,
somewhere a long way off, where I can have plenty
of work, and forget, and begin afresh."
</p>

<p>
But when Queenie came to this point she suddenly
broke down; an oppressive sense of loneliness,
as new as it was terrible, crushed on her with
overwhelming force.  For the first time Queenie's
brave spirit seemed utterly broken, and some of
the bitterest tears she ever shed wetted the
child's pillow.
</p>

<p>
As for Garth, he strolled on for a long time,
placidly enjoying his cigar.  He had delivered
his little lecture, and had then sent the girl in
soothed and comforted; so he told himself.  It
is true a sad and wistful glance from two large
dark eyes somewhat haunted him at intervals,
but he drove it persistently away.
</p>

<p>
"She is a sweet girl, a very sweet girl; but
she has her faults, like all of us," he said to
himself.  "I am glad I put her right about Dora.
If Dora ever comes here, it would not do for
Miss Marriott not to be friendly with her.  Dora
would have a right to expect then that the
others should give way to her, if she ever comes
here as my wife;" and here the young man's
pulses quickened a little, and in the darkness the
hot blood rushed to his face.  "Dora my wife! how
strange it sounds!  Well, I suppose it will
come to that some day; things seem shaping
themselves that way.  She will expect it, and
her father too, after what has passed.  I fancy
there is a kind of understanding between us.  I
wonder what sort of feeling she has for me?  She
keeps a fellow at such a distance, there is no
finding out; but I'll master her yet.  She will
soon find out, if I once make up my mind, that
I am not one to bear any shilly-shallying.  I
don't think I could stand nonsense from any
woman, not even from Dora.  Her father told
me once that if he died Dora would not have a
penny, though the other girls have tidy little
sums, each of them.  I like her all the better
for that.  Well, after all there is no hurry.
Being in love is all very well, but it is better to
take life easily, and digest matters a little;" and
with a conscious laugh that sounded oddly to
him in the darkness, Garth swung back the little
gate, and walked towards the house.
</p>

<p>
It was arranged that the sisters' modest
luggage should be sent over to the cottage in the
course of the morning, and that Queenie should
take possession of her new abode as soon as her
afternoon duties were discharged, and that Cathy
and Emmie should be there to receive her.
</p>

<p>
"I am to pour out tea my own self, and
Cathy has promised to make some of her
delicious cakes," exclaimed Emmie, rapturously.
"Langley will not come, though I have begged
her over and over again; she says we three will
be so much cosier together."
</p>

<p>
Queenie nodded and smiled as she bade her
little sister good-bye, and trudged down the
lane.  The sun was shining brightly; a rose-laden
wind blew freshly in her face; with the morning
light courage and hope had returned; she felt
half ashamed of her last night's sadness.  Queenie
was young, and life was strong within her.  In
youth happiness is a necessity, a second nature.
When the heart is young it rebels fiercely against
sorrow.  To exist is to hope; to hope is to
believe.
</p>

<p>
In youth we believe in miracles; utterly
impossible combinations would not surprise us;
the sun must stand still in our firmament,
the stars in their course fight against Sisera;
what has happened to others cannot happen
to us.
</p>

<p>
It is only bitter experience that tears down
this fairy glamor, the thin, gossamer film through
which we so long looked.  How barren and loveless
life appears then!  Our fairest hopes are
shipwrecked; a moral earthquake has shattered our
little world.  We look up at the heavens, and
they are as brass, and the earth under our feet
as wrought iron; while beyond, and in the dim
horizon, hollow voices seem to whisper a
perpetual dirge.
</p>

<p>
It is a terrible subject, this awful mystery of
pain, this dim and inscrutable decree, that man
is born to trouble.  Ah, well for those who, like
that tired wanderer in that far-off land, can
discern in their darkness and loneliness the
ladder that reaches from earth to heaven, and
feel the fanning of invisible wings even in their
heaviest stupor.
</p>

<p>
Queenie's healthy young nature recoiled and
shuddered at the first touch of probable pain; it
lay folded like a troublesome nightmare far back
among her thoughts.  It had mastered her last
night in the darkness; this morning the sunshine
had chased it away.
</p>

<p>
"How do I know? how does any one know?"
she said to herself, somewhat ambiguously, as
she sat among her children that morning.  "I
may be wrong; it may never happen; and if it
does, what is, is best, I suppose," and here she
sighed.  "I am thinking of him, of them both,
too much.  After all, what is he to me? a dear
friend, a very dear friend; but my friendship
must not cost me too much.  I will be good
and reasonable, and not ask more than a fair
amount of happiness; it is only children who
cry for the moon."
</p>

<p>
If you want to be happy, be good; it is a very
safe maxim.  Queenie felt quite bright as she
walked through the little town.  True, she had
a slight qualm as she passed the turning that led
to Church-Stile House; but she bravely stifled
the feeling, and hummed an air as she opened
her own little gate.
</p>

<p>
How fresh and bright it all looked.  The walk
was new gravelled, the little lawn looked trim
and green; roses and geraniums bloomed under
the windows; a honeysuckle was nicely trained
round the porch.  Emmie met her on the threshold,
and dragged her in with both hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queen, it is all so lovely; just like a
bit out of a story-book.  To think of you and me
living alone together in our own little cottage;
only you and me!"
</p>

<p>
"I am so glad you are happy, darling, because
that makes me happy," returned her sister,
affectionately.  "Ah, there is our little maid
Patience," as the girl stood curtseying and smoothing
down her clean apron, with a pleased, excited
face.  "Cathy&mdash;oh, Mr. Clayton, are you here
too?" as Garth's dark handsome face suddenly
beamed on her from the little parlor.
</p>

<p>
"I could not resist the pleasure of showing
you the transformation," he returned, gaily.
"You hardly know the place, do you?  Langley
and Cathy have done wonders.  It is a pretty
little home after all, and quite big enough for
you two, and I hope you will be as happy as the
day is long."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what have you all done!" exclaimed
Queenie, in a stifled voice.  Her heart began to
beat more quickly, an odd, choking feeling was
in her throat.  Was this their thought for her?
She could not for her life have spoken another
word as she followed Garth and Cathy into the
parlor.
</p>

<p>
"We have only put a table and some chairs
into the front room; it will be handy for Emmie
to learn her lessons and play there.  Langley
knew we must not put you to any unnecessary
expense," went on Garth, cheerfully.  "This is
very snug, is it not?"
</p>

<p>
Snug!  Queenie looked round her half dazed.
Had she ever seen this room before?  Though it
was summer, a little fire burnt in the grate.  There
was a crimson carpet; a grey rug was spread
invitingly; a couch stood by the open window.
There was a bird-cage, and a stand of flowers.
A pretty print hung over the mantel-piece.  Some
book-shelves with some tempting-looking volumes
had been fitted up over the corner cupboard.  A
gay little pink and white tea-service was on the
round table.  Some low basket-work chairs gave
an air of comfort.
</p>

<p>
Outside the transformation was still more
marked.  Instead of the green wilderness, all
docks and nettles, there was a long green lawn.
A broad gravel path bordered the window; a
few flower-beds had been cut in the turf.
</p>

<p>
"It is too late to do much this season; we
shall have it very pretty next summer," observed
Garth, in a cool, matter-of-fact tone, as he followed
her to the window.  "We have cut away a good
deal of the turf, as it made the house so damp;
the gravel path is far better.  Cathy wants you
to have a rockery and some ferns in one corner."
</p>

<p>
"It will look very nice," returned Queenie,
absently.
</p>

<p>
She had a misty vision after that of a bright
little kitchen that reminded her of a doll-house
that she had had as a child, and then of two
bed-rooms, one for herself, and one for Emmie,
with a small room for Patience, all as fresh as
white dimity could make them.  There were
flowers on the toilet-table; the little painted
chest of drawers had a sweet perfume of
lavender.  Everything was simple and well
chosen, and testified to thoughtful and loving
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cathy, what am I to say to him? what
am I to say to you all?" exclaimed poor Queenie,
feeling ready to throw her arms round her friend's
neck and burst into tears.  They were standing
in the little entry, and Garth was watching
them.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you going to give me tea after all this?"
he interposed, in a droll voice.  "Here I have been
gardening and carpentering and acting as odd
man to the establishment for I do not know how
long."
</p>

<p>
"Tea! oh, I forgot," returned Queenie, dashing
the tears from her eyes, and hurrying to her
place.
</p>

<p>
Garth stood near her a moment as he brought
her one of the basket chairs.
</p>

<p>
"Does our work satisfy you? have we given
you pleasure?" he asked, looking into her
downcast face rather anxiously.  "Do you think you
will be happy here, you and Emmie, in your own
little home?"
</p>

<p>
"It will be my own fault if I am not," she
faltered, holding out her hand; and such a look
of pure childish gratitude lit her dark eyes that
the young man reddened and turned aside.  "Oh,
Mr. Clayton, what can I do to repay you and
Langley?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush," he replied, lightly, and trying to turn
it off with a laugh; "there is no talk of payment
between friends; it is all understood between us.
You are only in our debt a little while; besides,
you are a rich woman now."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot," she exclaimed in such a tone
of dismay that the others looked quite startled.
"I mean&mdash;ah, yes, it will all be right soon,"
endeavouring to recover herself.
</p>

<p>
It was a cosy little meal after all.  Garth, who
saw that Queenie's fluctuating spirits needed
tranquillizing, set himself to reassure and soothe
her; and when he had succeeded, the three had one
of their long thoughtful talks.  By-and-bye Langley
came, and then Ted, and filled the little room
to overflowing, so that they betook themselves
to the porch and the lawn.
</p>

<p>
It was quite late when they separated, and
Queenie went up to her new little room.  The
glimmering lights in the village had been
extinguished.  The roads looked white and still in
the moonlight; only a faint barking from a dog
in the distance broke the stillness.
</p>

<p>
"How wrong and wicked I was last night!"
thought the girl humbly, as she stood by the
table, touching Langley's roses with caressing
fingers.  "I was lonely and sad; I wanted I
cannot tell what.  But to-night it is so different;
it is so sweet to feel he has done all this for
me; that it is his thought for me as well as
theirs; that, whatever happens, he will be my
friend, always my friend."

CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "She prayed me not to judge their cause from her,<br>
  That wrong'd it, sought far less for truth than power<br>
  In knowledge; something wild within her breast,<br>
  A greater than all knowledge, beat her down."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tennyson's 'Princess.'</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The days passed very tranquilly and pleasantly
after this for the inhabitants of the cottage.
</p>

<p>
Queenie had regained her brightness in a great
measure.  In spite of a certain dim fear that
haunted the background of her memory, her life
seemed full of a strange, sweet excitement.  The
buoyancy of youth was strong within her; the
knowledge of her secret wealth gave an intoxicating
flavor to everything.  As she walked to
and fro to her daily work, she felt like a
disguised princess, like the heroine of some fairy
story she had read once, spinning in her woollen
garments among the simple peasant folk.  "I
like being a rich woman after all," she said to
herself, "it is so amusing.  I feel just like
Cinderella before the pumpkin coach arrives; it
is a story-book sort of life I am leading.  Fancy
teaching in a village school when one has five
thousand a-year.  What shall I do with it all, I
wonder; I wish I might give some to Langley
and Cathy."
</p>

<p>
Queenie used to build all sorts of impossible
castles in the air when she was by herself or
with Emmie.
</p>

<p>
"What would you say if we were to be rich
one day, very, very rich?" she would ask
sometimes; but Emmie only shook her fair head.
</p>

<p>
"Rich, so that we should be obliged to leave
this dear cottage!  Oh no, Queen, I should not
like it at all.  I think it is so lovely, we two
living all alone together.  I never, never, never
was so happy in all my life before," finishing with
a prolonged hug.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that," murmured her sister,
fervently, passing her hands gently over the
child's upturned face.
</p>

<p>
The sharp outlines were filling out and rounding
daily; a soft bloom tinged the thin cheeks;
but there was still the same solemn, unchildlike
look in the large blue eyes.  Their expression
used to trouble Queenie sometimes.  "Would
the shadow of past woe never die out of
them?"
</p>

<p>
"Emmie, your eyes never smile," she said
once, "and yet you say you are so happy,
darling."
</p>

<p>
They were sitting alone in the porch; Cathy
had just left them, Garth had fetched her away.
Emmie was in her favorite position, with her
head resting on her crossed arms on her sister's
lap.  They had sat for a long time so without
speaking, only Queenie's fingers every now and
then twined in the child's golden hair.  "Why
don't you teach your eyes to smile too?" she
went on, half seriously.
</p>

<p>
Emmie wrinkled her brows thoughtfully.  "I
wish they would look like yours, Queen; but
then I never saw any eyes like yours, even Cathy
says so.  When you laugh they seem full of
brown sunshine, only so deep, deep down; and
when a great thought comes to you, one seems
to see it, somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush, you little flatterer;" but Queenie
blushed, well pleased, over the praise.
</p>

<p>
"You do not know half how beautiful I
think you," continued the child, earnestly; "it
makes me feel happy and good only to be
near you.  Do sisters always feel like that, I
wonder?"
</p>

<p>
"No, darling, not always."
</p>

<p>
"It must be because we love each other so.
There never was a time when your voice was not
like music to me.  Sometimes I love you so that
I ache all over with it; that was in the dreadful
old days, when I thought I must die and leave
you.  Oh, Queen, that would have been so very,
very miserable."
</p>

<p>
"Miserable to lose you, Emmie! don't speak
of it; I can't bear to think of it even now,"
pressing the child's slight figure closer in her
arms.
</p>

<p>
"It would not be so dreadful now; I should
not feel that you were quite so lonely, I mean.
No, I will not talk any more about it," catching
sight of Queenie's averted face; "we will never
be sad, you and I, never."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if we shall always live alone," she
went on, while Queenie dried her eyes.  "Perhaps
one day you will marry&mdash;people do, you know.
How strange that will be!"
</p>

<p>
"Should you dislike that idea very much, Emmie?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I don't know," in a reluctant tone.  "It
will spoil things rather; but if you like it,
Queen&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush," kissing her, "I think we are talking
dreadful nonsense.  Don't you know that I have
told you that we are leading a story-book life,
Emmie; first in that dreadful old garret, and
now in our pretty cottage?  By-and-bye it may
turn into a palace; who knows?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, then the prince will come; he always
does in fairy stories."
</p>

<p>
"No; he will ride away with the golden-haired
princess; they will disappear into the
forest together, and never come back.  We will
have Caleb and Molly to live with us instead."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that would be nice," returned the child,
clapping her hands.  "Only keep it the cottage;
we don't want the palace, Queen.  Is the prince
never to come back then?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not; would you have him leave
his fair one with the golden locks?  Fie, Emmie;
what a perfidious prince!  They will go riding on
and on for ever in the enchanted forest, while
you and I are walking hand in hand down the
long white road that people call life."
</p>

<p>
"What a funny idea!  I like the wood best,
Queenie."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, so do most people," she returned, rising
with a sigh; "but perhaps we do not know what
is best for us.  Don't you recollect the story we
once read of the child who wanted the star, and
missed all the flowers that grew under its feet,
and so pined away, and died of unfulfilled
longing?  You and I will be wiser than that,
little one; we will leave the star to move in its
own particular orbit, and gather all the sweet
homely flowers that grow in our way;" and
Queenie heaved another little sigh, for she was
moralizing to herself as well as to Emmie.
</p>

<p>
It was not often that the sisters were alone.
Cathy spent all her leisure hours at the cottage,
and even Langley would often bring her work
and sit with them in the porch of an evening.
Garth too was a frequent visitor; he would come
down the lane of an evening, and lean against
the little gate for half an hour at a time.
Sometimes he would come in and help the sisters with
their gardening, and bring them little gifts of
fruit and flowers.
</p>

<p>
When Langley or Cathy were there he would
join the little group in the porch, and linger
beside them for hours, but never when they were
alone.  Often Ted would saunter in and trail his
lazy length in one of the basket-work chairs.  On
these occasions Queenie would whisper to her
little sister, and by-and-bye there would be a
dainty repast set out for them of milk and fruit
and cakes.  How pretty and home-like their little
parlor looked then, with its soft shaded lamp
and bowl of roses!  Sometimes the moonlight
would stream in at the uncurtained window; one
or two large grey moths would wheel round their
heads.  Garth would go and smoke his cigar on
the broad gravel walk outside, while the girls
talked softly within!  Sometimes Mr. Logan would
walk across and assist at these simple festivities,
or Miss Cosie trip down the road with a grey
shawl pinned over her curls; for the cottage was
decidedly popular.
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, what makes you so quiet with Mr. Logan
now?" Queenie asked her one afternoon
when they were sitting together.
</p>

<p>
Emmie was spending the evening with the
Fawcetts.  Captain Fawcett had called for her,
and the two had gone off as usual hand in hand,
the Captain glancing over his stiff stock at his
little companion.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Logan had looked in on them on his way
to the school, and had brought them a message
from Miss Cosie.
</p>

<p>
"Charlotte wants you both to come over to
tea with her; she has a present of fine fruit from
the Abbey farm, and she wants our friends to
enjoy it with her.  Miss Faith is coming, and so
is Langley, and Garth has promised to look in
by-and-bye."
</p>

<p>
Queenie assented cheerfully; she had a warm
liking for Mr. Logan, and a great affection for Miss
Cosie, and nothing pleased her better than an
evening spent in their company.  It struck her
that Cathy acquiesced rather unwillingly in the
arrangement; she made one or two excuses
rather ungraciously, but Mr. Logan would take
no denial.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind all that; Charlotte and I will
quite expect you, Miss Catherine," was his
tranquil answer.
</p>

<p>
Cathy flushed in a displeased manner, but she
offered no more objections.  A cloud settled on
her brow now as Queenie spoke.
</p>

<p>
"You and he used to be such friends," she
continued.  "Don't you remember our talks in
the garret?  You used to call him your Mentor,
and write such long letters to him sometimes; a
word from him always seemed to influence you,
and now it seems to me as though you tried to
avoid him."
</p>

<p>
Cathy bit her lip and remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Cathy, it is so strange, so unlike you to
quarrel with your best friend.  The more I see
Mr. Logan, the more I honor and revere him,
Such intellect, and yet the simplicity and
guilelessness of a child.  I believe he lives only to do
good; he reminds one of those olden saints of
whom one reads."
</p>

<p>
Cathy's dark eyes flashed, and then grew
humid with repressed feeling.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is just it; one cannot breathe in
such a rarefied atmosphere."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you find his goodness so
oppressive?  I am not like you then; a really
good man rests me somehow.  I feel in looking
at one as if I were in the presence of God's
highest work, as though even He could do
nothing better&mdash;the best and finished work before
the seventh day's rest, when 'God saw that it
was good.'  Think of that, Cathy.  I suppose,"
continued Queenie, reverently, "He saw the
one Divine likeness stamped on the face of
humanity, the one Man shining through the
ages of men.  Oh, there is nothing grander in
all creation than a really good man."
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Queenie; I am not in a mood for your
great thoughts to-night; you must come down
and meet me on my own level.  You don't know
how inconceivably little and mean and
insignificant he makes me feel.  I begin," enunciating
her words with an effort, "to feel afraid of myself
and him."
</p>

<p>
"Afraid of Mr. Logan! what nonsense, Catherina
<i>mia</i>.  Why a child, the very poorest and most
miserable child, would slip its little hand in his
fearlessly, and be soothed and comforted by the
mere contact."
</p>

<p>
"A child, ah, yes; but I am a woman," returned
Cathy, almost inaudibly.
</p>

<p>
"You are a girl, and so am I, which means we
are faulty, imperfect creatures, full of fads and
fancies, and brimful of mischief I dare say.  Do
you think a man like Mr. Logan, who knows
human nature, expects us to be perfection?"
</p>

<p>
"No; but he expects us to grow up to him,
and live and breathe in his atmosphere.  But I
can't, Queenie; I have tried, I have tried so hard
to be good, but it stifles me; I feel just as I do
when I am teaching the children in one of those
close cottages, as though I must rush out and
get some air, or I shall be suffocated."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you undervalue yourself so?" returned
her friend, looking at her affectionately.
"You have got into the habit; it is such a pity,
and it spoils you so.  I think you good, and
you are good."  But Cathy only pushed the
dark locks back from her face, and looked
disconsolate.
</p>

<p>
"What constitutes goodness, I wonder?"
continued Queenie, reflectively.  "We are simple
every-day folk; we cannot all be saints.  In
every age there will be giants in the land.  You
and I, dear old Cath, must be content with
being 'the little ones.'
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you are nearer his standard than I," in
a low, bitter voice.
</p>

<p>
"It must be a painfully low one then.  For
shame, when you know all my faults as well as
you know your own.  I for one will always
believe in you.  You have such a great heart,
Cathy; you would lay down your life for those
you love."
</p>

<p>
"You are right there."
</p>

<p>
"Is unselfishness so common a virtue in this
world that one can afford to despise it?  How
often have I admired your thorough honesty,
your hatred of anything crooked and mean.
There is nothing little about you, that is why I
care for you so much."
</p>

<p>
"All pagan virtues," with a faint smile.
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, your self-depreciation is incorrigible."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what I mean to do," rousing herself,
but speaking in the same suppressed voice.
"I want to go away from here; this little corner
of the world stifles me.  I get so tired of it all,
the trying to be good and keep down my
restlessness, I mean.  I have so few home duties;
Langley and Garth do not really want me.  I
should not be much missed."
</p>

<p>
"You would leave me and Emmie!" incredulously.
</p>

<p>
"Poor old Madam Dignity.  It does seem
hard, I know.  Never mind, I should come back
to you all the better and the happier for having
worked off my superfluous steam.  One must
have a safety-valve somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"But, Cathy, you are surely not serious.  I
cannot see any reason for this absurd restlessness;
you must throw it off, fight against it, as other
women do."
</p>

<p>
"My dear oracle, there are women and women.
I really believe there is a little of the savage
about me; I do so object to be tamed down, and
made submissive to mere conventionality.
Perhaps my great grandmother was a Pawnee or
a Zingaree; I must ask Garth.  I don't feel
completely Saxon or Celtic."
</p>

<p>
"How can you talk so wildly?"
</p>

<p>
"Grandmamma Wolf, what great eyes you
have got.  Don't eat me up in your fiery
indignation.  Seriously, Queen, don't you think it
would be good for me to go away for a time?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you so anxious to leave us all?" regretfully,
but moved by a certain passionate pain in
the girl's face.
</p>

<p>
"I think I am.  Yes, though I shall half
break my heart over it.  I think I am.  You see,
I am not like other girls.  I cannot lead a quiet,
humdrum life that means nothing and leads to
nowhere&mdash;that is just it.  I want to see the
world, to rub up against other folk, and study
their characters and idiosyncrasies; to have a
life of my own to live, not tagged on to other
people."
</p>

<p>
"But women cannot choose their own life.  It
always seems to me that their fate is decided
for them," interrupted Queenie, in a puzzled
tone.
</p>

<p>
"Not for my sort of women.  Thank Heaven I
am still myself enough to decide my own fate.
No, I am not crazy, Queen," as her friend looked
at her with a sorely perplexed countenance;
"my plan is a very reasonable and sensible one.
I have an idea that my vocation is nursing; not
stupid sort of illnesses, but downright hard
hospital nursing&mdash;broken limbs, and accidents,
and horrible fever cases; real horrors, not
imaginary, mind.  Nervous or hypochondriacal patients,
no, thank you; Catherine Clayton will have
nothing to say to them."
</p>

<p>
"Go on," was the injunction, in a resigned
voice, as Cathy paused to collect her breath.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Faith and I have had a long talk about
it; she is not sceptical like you, she knows too
well how bad this sort of restlessness is to bear;
besides, she has tried it herself, and loves the
work."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I can understand such a life suiting
Miss Faith; she is one of those ministering
women born to smooth sick pillows.  But you,
Cathy," trying hard to repress a smile.
</p>

<p>
"I grant you that I might deal the aforesaid
pillow an occasional thump if my patient should
prove refractory; but all the same, I feel as
though bandages and blisters were my vocation.
I have theories about nursing that would astonish
your weak mind.  I believe a nurse requires as
thorough an education, as careful a training, as
any medical student.  Miss Faith is quite of my
opinion; she advises me to go to London."
</p>

<p>
"I did not know Miss Faith was your
confidant," in a slightly hurt voice.
</p>

<p>
"Only in this one thing, my dear Madam
Dignity," with a penitent squeeze.  "She said
London, and I said 'Amen.'  Garth knows the
house surgeon at St. George's, and the matron is
a great friend of Langley's; that makes it so easy
to carry out my plan."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, I do believe that you are serious."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you have spoken a sensible word at last."
</p>

<p>
"The work will be most revolting."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think that will daunt me?  Are not
women sent into the world to minister and
relieve pain?"
</p>

<p>
"The labor will be excessive, and trying in
the extreme," persisted Queenie.  "Have you
ever seen the wards of a hospital?  I believe you
will soon sicken and droop for your northern
home."
</p>

<p>
"Pshaw!  I should scorn to be such a coward;
half-measures are not to my taste."
</p>

<p>
"That is all very well now; but when you
are weak and unnerved by watching."
</p>

<p>
"Thank heavens I don't know what nerves
are, my dear.  A healthy mind and body are the
first requisites for a good nurse.  Just as indecision
is fatal to a general's success, so would nervousness
ruin the best trained nurse.  Even Garth
owns that as far as that goes my physique is
perfect."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean that you have already spoken
to him?" in aghast voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and to Langley too.  They were surprised
of course, and rather incredulous, but they
do not thoroughly oppose my project.  Langley
has told Garth more than once that our quiet
home life will never suit me.  Langley is a wise
woman, Queen."
</p>

<p>
"And you have communicated your plan to
all but me," very sadly.  "What has become of
our old confidence, Cathy?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! there speaks jealousy, not my Queen.
If I did not tell you, it was because I would not
harass you with half-digested plans.  I could do
nothing without Garth's and Langley's consent."
</p>

<p>
"They have given it then?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet; but I know they will.  You see,
my demands were very moderate.  I told Garth
my views: that every woman should have a
definite work or trade, and that it should, if
possible, be self-supporting; that teaching was
not to my taste, but that nursing was.  And then
I asked his permission to go up to London for a
six months' trial.  Could there be anything more
sensible?"
</p>

<p>
"But did they not question you about your
reason?  No, Cathy, do not turn away from me;
am I not your friend? can I not see that you are
unhappy?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall not be unhappy if I can once get
away from here and taste freedom; when I am
no longer straitened, thralled, in bondage.  No,
Queenie dear, indeed I have told you all that I
know about myself; there is nothing more to
tell.  Hush! here comes Miss Faith; not a word
of this before her.  I am tired of the subject;
your scepticism has quite exhausted me."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy, Cathy, what an incomprehensible
being you are!" sighed Queenie, as she ran off to
fetch her broad-brimmed hat.
</p>

<p>
Miss Faith had come to fetch them to the
Vicarage.  Her quiet face brightened at the
sight of the girls.  An evening's pleasure, a
simple tea-drinking with her friends, was an
unwonted event in her colorless life.
</p>

<p>
"It was so good of Cara to spare her a whole
evening, just when they were finishing the last
chapter of 'Trench's Parables,' and she wanted
her to begin Bossuet's life.  It was very unselfish
of Cara," she went on, smoothing down the soft
grey merino, with its fresh lace ruffles; for Miss
Faith was not without her pet vanities, and fine
lace ruffles round the neck and wrists were her
special weakness.
</p>

<p>
As they crossed the road Garth emerged from
the lane that led to Church-Stile House.  A
gleam of pleasure overspread his face as he
greeted them.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Miss Faith; what an age it is
since we have seen you.  How are the rest of
the cardinal virtues? and what new book-torture
is Miss Charity inflicting on you?  By-the-bye,
ladies, have you heard the wonderful
intelligence? the new doctor has made his
appearance."
</p>

<p>
"No; oh, tell us all about it!" exclaimed the
three.  "Who is he?  What is his name?  Is
he young and nice-looking; or is he old, and
stout, and horridly uninteresting?" this last
from Cathy.
</p>

<p>
Garth looked benignantly at their agitated
countenances.  Their curiosity imparted a relish
to the news.  Here he had been in possession of
the latest intelligence for at least half an hour;
had met the new-comer with Mr. Logan, and
had shaken hands with him; had discussed the
weather and the crops, after the usual manner
of Englishmen, while Hepshaw was buried in
profound ignorance of the acquisition it had
gained.
</p>

<p>
"So you have not heard the news?" he repeated, calmly.
</p>

<p>
"No; of course not.  Do be quick, Garth.
Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is the question."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen him? has any one told you
about him? will he live in Dr. Morgan's old
house? is he married? has he a tribe of children?"
</p>

<p>
"One question at a time, ladies.  Who asked
if he were married?  Cathy, of course.  No; I
believe not; but I never asked him."
</p>

<p>
"You have seen him then.  Oh, Miss Faith,
does he not deserve to be shaken, to keep us in
this suspense?  Perhaps, after all, he is only a
red-headed little apothecary."
</p>

<p>
"That I am sure he is not."
</p>

<p>
"He is nice then?" stimulated to fresh efforts
by the twinkle in her brother's eye.  Garth was
evidently bent on enjoying himself at their
expense.
</p>

<p>
"That depends on what you call nice.  He
seemed tolerably pleasant, talked good English
without a twang, and had no disagreeable
provincial accent."
</p>

<p>
"Young or old?"
</p>

<p>
"About forty, I should say; couldn't answer
for a year or two."
</p>

<p>
"Over forty!  Then he must be an old bachelor.
How dreadfully uninteresting!"
</p>

<p>
"I will repeat that speech to Mr. Logan."
</p>

<p>
Cathy moved aside as if she had been stung.
</p>

<p>
Miss Faith hazarded the next question rather
timidly: "Was he tall or short?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither the one nor the other."
</p>

<p>
Still further questioning elicited no remarkable
items of information.  He was not very stout,
neither was he particularly thin; had a pleasant
voice and manner; was somewhat sallow in
complexion; and was becoming decidedly grey; did
not wear spectacles, and had shrewd and rather
humorous eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Where was he going to live?"
</p>

<p>
"Did not ask him; is at present putting up
at the Deer-hound.  Comes from Carlisle, so he
says."
</p>

<p>
"From Carlisle?" in a faint voice from Miss
Faith.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  His name is Stewart, Angus Stewart,
or rather Dr. Stewart, as he is now.  On the
whole he is a gentlemanly sort of fellow, and
likely to prove an acquisition to our little circle.
I say, Cath, won't Mrs. Morris set her cap at
him?"
</p>

<p>
"I think we had better walk on now," returned
Cathy, abruptly, at the mention of the name.
She had started violently, and had shot a quick,
sidelong glance at Miss Faith.  "Come, Miss
Faith, we shall be late for tea."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; we shall be late," she returned,
mechanically, putting a shaking hand on the girl's
arm, as though to steady herself.  There was not
a tinge of color in Miss Faith's fair face; her
breath came and went unevenly; she spoke in
little gasps.  "Are you sure that we heard right,
Cathy?  did your brother say his name was
Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Angus Stewart," returned Cathy, in a
brisk, off-hand voice; "he comes from Carlisle.
Ah, by the-bye, I should not be surprised if he
should prove an old hospital acquaintance of
yours, Miss Faith.  What fun that will be!
After all, the world is not so large as one thinks
it."
</p>

<p>
"It is very strange," rejoined Miss Faith, and
her lips trembled nervously over her words.
"The coincidence of the name and the place
startled me a little.  I knew some one of that
name in Carlisle&mdash;let me see&mdash;ten years ago."
</p>

<p>
"How very odd!" returned her companion,
with well-counterfeited surprise, and looking
straight before her.  "Only ten years ago?  Ah,
then it must be the same; besides, the name is
so very uncommon."
</p>

<p>
"Angus? ah, that is what he used to say.
He was very proud of his name.  He told me
once that was all of which he had to be proud.
He was so poor, he meant.  He was the house
surgeon, and one used to see a good deal of him.
He had a mother and sister, I remember, who
lived in such a tiny house in the town."
</p>

<p>
"And you have never seen him since?"
</p>

<p>
"No," hesitating and faltering; "I had to
give up nursing, and come back to Cara.  One
loses friends sometimes in that way.  It was
hard, of course; for I loved my work and my
children; but one must do hard things sometimes
in this world," finished poor Miss Faith,
with unconscious philosophy.

CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
THE NEW DOCTOR.
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "I learn'd at last submission to my lot,<br>
  But, though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot."<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Cowper.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I wonder how women of thirty-five feel
under these circumstances," thought Cathy, as
she followed the others up the narrow dark
staircase leading to Miss Cosie's neat sanctum.  "I
should have imagined all sentiment would have
been worried out of them by this time, in this
dismal old mill-pond they call life.  It is very
odd, but it is amusing too," she continued, with
a certain girlish curiosity at the elderly romance
that was impending before her eyes.  After all it
was not without its pathos.  "Perhaps he will not
recognize her when they meet, or most likely he
has a wife and two or three children somewhere;
I would not answer for him.  It is the women
who are faithful in these cases.  In my opinion
Jacob is the exception, not the rule.  Poor old
Jacob, how threadbare they have worn him!  He
was very patient and deep, but I liked Esau
best."
</p>

<p>
Cathy mused on in her rambling fashion.  Now
and then she and Queenie exchanged glances
full of meaning.
</p>

<p>
"Is it&mdash;can it really be he?" whispered
Queenie, as she tied and untied Cathy's velvet.
</p>

<p>
"Not a doubt of it," replied the other.  "Hush! we
shall hear more by-and-bye."
</p>

<p>
Miss Faith looked at them both with soft dazed
eyes.  She had no idea that they were talking of
her.  "Angus Stewart! there cannot be two of
that name," she said to herself, as she smoothed
out her ruffles with trembling hands, and tried
to adjust her pearl brooch to her liking.  "I
wonder when I shall see him, and if he will know
me again."  But here Miss Cosie rushed upon
them with a small whirlwind of interjections and
exclamations.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dears; there, there, you all look as
fresh as rosebuds.  What do you think?  The
most wonderful thing has happened.  Just fancy
Christopher taking it into his head to bring him
here!"
</p>

<p>
"To bring whom, dear Miss Cosie?" asked
Cathy quickly, for Miss Faith's color was
varying dangerously.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Mac'ivor, or what's his name&mdash;something
Scotch I am sure.  The new doctor, I
mean.  And there they are talking as comfortably
as though they had known each other for years,
instead of minutes.  Christopher has taken him
over to the church already.'
</p>

<p>
"If Mr. Stewart be here we had better go
down," observed Cathy, demurely, but her eyes
danced with fun.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Stewart, of course.  There, there, my
dear, my head is like a sieve, as Kit always tells
me.  'Why, Charlotte, there must be a hole in your
brain somewhere,' as he often says.  And there he
is, dear fellow, looking as pleased as though he
had got some one to his liking; and indeed he
seems a pleasant, sociable sort of person."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but your tea will be spoiled if we stand
talking any longer," put in artful Cathy; and
Miss Cosie took the hint, and trotted off in her
velvet high-heeled slippers, looking like a little
grey mouse of a woman, in her dove-colored
gown and soft Shetland shawl.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, my dear, if I had not forgotten
all about the tea!" they could hear her exclaim.
as she whisked down the passage.
</p>

<p>
"Now we will go down," exclaimed Cathy,
promptly.  "Come, Miss Faith, you are just as
nice as possible;" for the nervous fingers were
still adjusting the troublesome ruffle.  "Think
what a loss you have over those last chapters of
'Trench's Parables,' and how Cara will miss you,"
continued the mischievous girl, as she hurried on
her trembling companion.  "You have exchanged
'the feast of reason and the flow of soul' just
for Miss Cosie's junket and fruit."
</p>

<p>
"I wish&mdash;I almost wish I were back with Cara,"
gasped poor Miss Faith at the parlor door; and
indeed the ordeal was a trying one even to a
woman of thirty-five.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Logan made the necessary introductions
as easily as possible.  "Here, ladies, is our new
doctor, Mr. Stewart; give him a hearty welcome
to Hepshaw.  This is our girls' school-mistress,
Miss Marriott, and this is Miss Catherine Clayton,
but Miss Faith Palmer ought to have come first."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Faith Palmer?" queried a pleasant voice,
for the parlor was somewhat dim; "here at least
I ought to require no introduction," and the
new-comer pressed forward to catch a farther glimpse
of Miss Faith's pale face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we are old friends, Mr. Stewart," she
returned, putting a very cold hand in his.  She
was glad of the half-light; he could not see her,
she thought.  How his voice thrilled her?  Was it
really ten years ago since she had last heard it?
</p>

<p>
"You are the last person I expected to see to-night,"
he continued, still standing near her.  "It
was very forgetful of me.  I remember now that
you said you lived at Hepshaw, but all sorts of
things have driven it clean out of my head."
</p>

<p>
"All sorts of things!  He is married then,"
argued Cathy, shrewdly.  "Oh, you men, you men!"
</p>

<p>
"Ten years is a long time, a very long time,"
faltered Miss Faith.  She experienced a chill
feeling at the same moment.  Was it a presentiment?
</p>

<p>
"Is it ten years since we met?  I had no idea it
was so long," he returned, pulling his whiskers
reflectively.  "Do you recollect the hospital and
the boys' ward.  What a capital nurse you used
to be, Miss Faith, and how attached your little
patients were to you!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it&mdash;is everything just the same?" she
asked, nervously.
</p>

<p>
"As when I was house surgeon there, do you
mean?  I don't know; I have been away from
Carlisle a good many years.  The hospital work
got humdrum somehow, and I had a berth
offered me as army surgeon in Bombay; and as
Alice was married, and my mother was dead, I
thought I might as well try my luck.  I got
tired of it though."
</p>

<p>
"Alice married!"; with a quick flush of interest.
They were sitting at Miss Cosie's tea-table now.
Mr. Stewart was by his hostess, but he had found
room for his old acquaintance beside him.
</p>

<p>
"You can't think how pleasant it is to meet an
old friend in a strange place," he had observed
confidentially to Miss Cosie, and the little woman
had nodded and smiled delightedly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Alice is married; pretty girls will sometimes,"
with the humorous sparkle in his eyes that
she remembered so well.  "She married a
clergyman in Lincolnshire, and has two fine boys
of whom she is very proud; I have just been
staying with them in their pleasant vicarage.
By-the-bye, she asked after you."
</p>

<p>
"After me?" with another rush of sensitive
color that made her look years younger.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; she asked if I had seen you, but I could
not satisfy her on that point.  Don't you think it
was a shabby trick, Miss Faith, vanishing from
Carlisle as you did, and never coming back?  I
always meant to ask you that question if we
ever met again."
</p>

<p>
"I hoped to come back; I never meant to
leave like that," she returned in such a low
voice that Dr. Stewart had some trouble to hear
her.  "It was my sister's accident.  You remember
that I told you when I wished your mother and
Alice good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but I trusted that it was only a
temporary affair, and that you might soon have
been set free."
</p>

<p>
"I am not free yet," in a sad voice that went
far to explain to Dr. Stewart the meaning of the
worn, patient face and set lines.
</p>

<p>
The Faith Palmer of ten years ago had been a
fair, pretty girl, with the lightest step and the
happiest laugh imaginable, and all manner of
bright winning ways.  It was a sweet face still,
he thought, only so thin and careworn, and all
the soft coloring faded.  Even her voice was
subdued and quieted past recognition; the
despondence of the key had touched him painfully
from the first.
</p>

<p>
Faith's scrutiny had not been half so severe.
Dr. Stewart was older, of coarse, and browner;
well, and stouter, and he was becoming very
grey; but what did that matter?  There were the
pleasant outlines, that had lingered for ten years
in her memory, the shrewd, twinkling eyes, with
their touch of humor, and the clear, genial voice.
</p>

<p>
"What does that mean? we are none of us
free, for the matter of that," he asked abruptly, but
not unkindly.  "Here I am tying myself down
for life in this northern village, because an Indian
sun chose to play the most confounded tricks
with my liver, and to make my existence a
burthen to me.  Do you mean that your sister
is still an invalid?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I have been nursing her for ten years.
There are the others, but she has got used to me.
Poor Cara, she is to lie down all her life, they
say."
</p>

<p>
"Humph! that accounts for it," with a
dissatisfied glance, and pulling his whiskers rather
fiercely.  "Well, Miss Faith, I can't say
home-nursing has agreed with you."
</p>

<p>
"That means that you find me changed,"
thought poor Miss Faith, trying to swallow down a
very large lump in her throat.  She had sustained
her share in the conversation with tolerable
success up to the present moment, but now the
chilliness was creeping over her again.  Why had
he not tried to find out what had become of her?
Hepshaw and Carlisle were not so very far apart
after all.  True, she had promised him to return,
and had left him in perfect confidence that she
would redeem her promise; but she had not been
to blame for her failure.  "I gave it all up,
all that I knew was waiting for me, because
Cara wanted me," she thought; "but he
never tried to find out what had become of me."
</p>

<p>
It was well for Faith Palmer that Cathy, who
was watching them from the other side of the
table, struck in boldly at this juncture; it gave
her time to swallow down the troublesome lump,
and regain her lost self-command.  During the
animated talk that followed, and in which
Dr. Stewart bore a chief part, she sat plaiting the
snowy table-cloth with her slender fingers, and
saying over and over to herself, "Ten years, and
he never cared to know whether I was alive or
dead."
</p>

<p>
When tea was over she moved away from him,
and took refuge beside Miss Cosie and her
knitting.  He would amuse himself with the
younger ones of course.  She had noticed already
that Cathy had seemed to interest him with her
frank liveliness, and then there were Langley and
Queenie.  Queenie was looking so pretty this
evening, with those deep-colored roses in her
dark dress.  If only she could sit quiet in her
corner, and watch him unobserved!  It was hard
work finding appropriate answers to Miss Cosie's
somewhat rambling remarks.
</p>

<p>
"Of course he will take a fancy to one of
them," she thought, taking advantage of a pause
during which Miss Cosie counted her stitches,
and quite ignoring the fact that there might
possibly be a Mrs. Stewart somewhere.  "I
wonder which it will be.  Queenie Marriott is far
prettier to my taste, her eyes are lovely; but
then Cathy is very taking.  Men of forty generally
fall in love with young girls; and then he is
such a young-looking man, and does not look his
age," and Faith sighed as she thought of her
faded youth.
</p>

<p>
"Did you speak, my dear?" asked Miss Cosie,
at this point.  "Knit one, purl two, and knit two
together.  There, there, I am a stupid companion.
Why don't you go and join that merry party
opposite?  Look at Kit; how delighted he
seems with the doctor."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Cosie," stammered Faith, "did he&mdash;did
Dr. Stewart say anything about his being
married.  He did not mention his wife, I mean.
Cathy was wondering, and, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Married! why, to be sure, how stupid of us!
I never thought of such a thing for a moment.
Of course he must be; and not one of us has
asked after her," and the little woman patted her
big curls in a flurried manner.  "Kit, Kit, my
dear," in a loud whisper, "do tell Dr. Stewart
that I want to speak to him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Miss Cosie, pray don't.  How can you
think of doing such a thing?" exclaimed Faith, in
a perfect agony at this unexpected proceeding.
"He is such a stranger.  What will he think of
us?"  But her protestations were in vain, for
Dr. Stewart had left his place with alacrity, and had
come up to them with the brightest possible
face.
</p>

<p>
"Did you send for me, Miss Logan?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear, dear, to think of that, when I have not
been called Miss Logan for the last twenty years.
Why even the Bishop says Miss Cosie; but then,
as Faith says, you are a stranger among us, and
don't know our manners."
</p>

<p>
"Did Miss Faith say that?  Well, I shall hope
not to be a stranger long.  I will promise not to
offend again, Miss Cosie."
</p>

<p>
"There, there, my dear, if he has not got it as
pat as possible, as though he had known me all
my life.  Why even the school-children, bless
their little hearts, call me Miss Cosie; I don't
know myself under any other name.  But talking
of names, Dr. Stewart, and you have a nice
funny, outlandish one of your own, here we
have been together for two whole hours and not
one of us has asked after Mrs. Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"My mother is dead, Miss Cosie," he replied,
very gravely, while Faith flushed and grew white,
and wished herself home again with Cara.  It
was too dreadful of Miss Cosie.  What would he
think of them?
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing! well, well, she is better off,"
returned his sympathizing questioner; "she is
where the weary are at rest, you know, one must
think of that.  But I was not speaking of your
poor dear mother, Dr. Stewart, but of your
wife."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Dr. Stewart looked at her in
some perplexity, and then he got red, and glanced
at Faith; but Faith had taken possession of Miss
Cosie's knitting, and was doing her best to
reduce it to hopeless and intricate confusion, and
then a decidedly amused expression crossed his
face.
</p>

<p>
"What makes you saddle me with a wife, Miss Cosie?"
</p>

<p>
"There, there, you must not take it amiss of
us," returned the little woman earnestly, laying
her hand on his arm.  "Of course we shall be
glad to know her; and if there is anything that
I can do to make her more comfortable when
the poor thing comes amongst us a stranger, I
will do it with all my heart."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear Miss Cosie," with a smile, "I
have no wife."
</p>

<p>
"No wife!" and Miss Cosie's eyes grew
round, and she threw up her plump little hands
in astonishment; "no wife! do you mean she is
dead too, Dr. Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean that I never had one," laughing now
outright.  "Don't you know poor men have no
right to such luxuries?  When one has a mother
and a sister to maintain, one must put away those
sort of thoughts, however much one is tempted,"
and Dr. Stewart spoke now in a curiously
constrained voice.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Cosie, I must go home now, Cara will
be looking for me," exclaimed Faith, rising
hurriedly.  There was a misty look in the soft
blue eyes, and the color had returned to her
face.
</p>

<p>
"May I take the right of an old friend, and
come and see you and your sisters to-morrow,"
asked Dr. Stewart, as he held her hand.  "May
I come and talk to this Cara, of whom I have
heard so much?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; we shall be very glad," she replied,
almost inaudibly, and then he let her go.
</p>

<p>
He left Miss Cosie after that, and went back
to the little group gathered round the window;
but a change had come over them; they seemed
talking seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Catherine, are you in earnest?" Mr. Logan
was saying, in an incredulous voice.  He
pushed his spectacles up to his forehead as he
spoke, and the keen, near-sighted eyes seemed to
probe the girl's soul as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
Cathy winced, but she maintained her ground
unflinchingly.
</p>

<p>
"Ask Garth and Langley what they think on
that subject."
</p>

<p>
"She is leading us a sad life about it," returned
Garth, tilting his chair that he might have a
better view of Queenie.  Somehow the combination
of the dark dress and roses took his fancy.
Miss Marriott was certainly very pretty to-night;
even Dr. Stewart seemed to find a certain
witchery in the dark eyes, at least Garth thought
so, which put him a trifle out of humor.  He had
been so long without a rival in Hepshaw, that
the introduction of this sudden new element of
manhood was likely to disturb his equanimity.
"Langley says there are no valid objections, so I
suppose we shall have to let her go."
</p>

<p>
"Let us ask Dr. Stewart what he thinks of
it," put in Langley, and, to her sister's relief, she
quietly turned to him, and gave a brief sketch of
Cathy's plan, to which he listened with ready
interest, asking a question here and there in a
skilful professional manner.  When he was in
possession of all the facts, he turned to Cathy.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why it should not answer; at
least you might give it a trial.  I like your idea
of every woman being trained to a definite
employment; I never could understand the
enforced helplessness of the sex.  I have known
pitiable examples of women being left dependent
on over-taxed brothers, or turned upon the world
absolutely without resources."
</p>

<p>
"Your rule holds good with generalities,
but in Miss Catherine's case," began Mr. Logan,
but Cathy somewhat proudly interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"If it be Miss Catherine's wish to be
independent, and hold her own against the world,
no one has a right to interfere.  No," speaking
with sparkling eyes, and a certain storminess of
manner, "I am not one of those women who
could bear to be cramped and swathed with the
swaddling-clothes of conventionality; I claim
my right to work for work's sake, and to be as
free as any other of God's creatures."
</p>

<p>
"You are quite right, Miss Clayton; I admire
your sentiments," observed Dr. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear," from Garth, somewhat
sarcastically.  He did not wholly approve of his wilful
little sister's plan.  "Bless me, child, you are
hardly more than eighteen; you seem in a vast
hurry to make yourself independent of your
brother; no one wants to get rid of you, you
little monkey."
</p>

<p>
Cathy melted a little at that.  She gave him
an affectionate glance.
</p>

<p>
"All the same, you will be wanting to get rid
of me one of these days," she returned, meaningly,
and Garth reddened.  "Besides, I don't mean to
leave home for good and all; I want to go up to
London and learn nursing in all its branches,
and then I shall know if I am fit for it.  A fair
trial is all I ask; and if Garth consents, no one
has a right to raise an objection," in an injured,
appealing voice.
</p>

<p>
"You have chosen a noble profession," began
Dr. Stewart warmly, but Mr. Logan quietly
interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Granted, my dear sir, provided the motives
are equally noble."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Cath, you are going to catch it from
your Mentor," observed her brother in an amused
tone.  "Mr. Logan has discovered a flaw in your
grand scheme."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose one can discover flaws in
everything," returned the Vicar in a musing tone.
"Youth is the time for great projects; sometimes
they are another name for restlessness and
discontent.  Youth lights a candle,&mdash;a farthing
dip-light sometimes,&mdash;and sets out through the world
to look for duties, and leaves the hearth-stone
cold, and old hearts growing chill round it.  I
have an old-fashioned notion, that woman's mission,
in its perfectness, very rarely lies beyond
the threshold of home."
</p>

<p>
"How about Florence Nightingale?" interrupted Cathy.
</p>

<p>
"Or Sarah Judson?" from Langley.
</p>

<p>
"Or Mrs. Fry? or Joan of Arc?" commented
Dr. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
"Or we might add Grace Darling, and a score
of others," put in Garth.
</p>

<p>
"All typical women, raised up in their generation
to perform a certain work, and performing
it right nobly.  The world calls them heroines,
and with reason.  They are heroines in the true
sense of the word, for they have discovered
the needs of the world, and, recognizing their
own power to remedy, have fearlessly dared to
cross the threshold of home duty for the larger
arena, where only the strong prevail and the
weak go to the wall."
</p>

<p>
"Cathy does not pretend to be a Florence
Nightingale," put in Langley, quietly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you always told us to elevate our
standard?" a little defiantly, from Cathy.
</p>

<p>
"The higher the better," with a benign glance
at her; "but it must be a true standard, unselfishness
and self-sacrifice for its base, and built
up of pure motives.  If it be one-sided it will
topple over."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I can't read parables," rather crossly.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure that you are really trying to
read mine?  You remind me of some little child,
Miss Catherine, gathering shells by the sea-shore,
and throwing all the pearls away.  If you look
far enough into the meanings of things you will
perceive their value.  About your plan, now?"
</p>

<p>
"I will not hear a word against it," she
returned wilfully, and going over to Miss Cosie.
"It is bad enough to have to argue with all one's
home people; but to be lectured in public, and
before Dr. Stewart&mdash;no, indeed, Mr. Logan."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I will reserve what I have to say
in private," he returned, looking after her with a
sort of indulgent tenderness, as though she were
the little child to whom he had compared her;
and Queenie, who was near him, saw a certain
vivid brightness in his eyes as he watched her.
</p>

<p>
The circle broke up after this; but, though it
was tolerably late for Hepshaw hours, they did
not yet talk of separating.  It was a lovely
moonlight night, and, at Garth's invitation,
Queenie strolled with him up and down the
Vicar's steep, narrow garden.  Dr. Stewart joined
them, and talked for some time about his Indian
experiences.
</p>

<p>
They were both novel and interesting, and
engrossed them wholly.  Queenie was so fascinated
by his description of Indian scenery that
she with difficulty remembered the lateness of
the hour, and that Langley and Cathy would be
wondering at her absence; but she at last made
an excuse to leave them.
</p>

<p>
She lingered for a moment under the shadow
of the house to watch the two dark figures still
pacing up and down the steep path.  This evening's
excitement had quickened her pulses.  The
arrival of the stranger, Miss Faith's repressed
agitation at the sight of him, Cathy's strange
restlessness and plan for leaving home, had
disturbed the even current of events.  The moral
air seemed charged with electricity and rife
with disturbance; somewhere a storm seemed
impending.  This sense of movement, of vitality,
was not unpleasant; youth dreads nothing
more than monotony.  It is only in age that
one sits with folded hands expecting nothing.
Garth's manner, too, had given her pleasure;
it had been more than usually friendly.  There
had been appreciation in his glance, a certain
cordiality in his tone, that had fallen
pleasantly on her ear.  "If he will only remain my
friend I shall envy no girl her lover," thought
Queenie, with a sudden fulness of heart; but at
that moment she was startled from her reverie
by the sound of voices in the dark entry behind
her.
</p>

<p>
She could hear Mr. Logan's quiet tones, and
yes, surely that voice answering him was Cathy's!
Before she could free herself a sentence or two
reached her ear.
</p>

<p>
"You will think over what I have said, my
child?  You will be good and give up this, to
please me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," returned the girl passionately, and
the low, vehement tones gave Queenie a shock,
for they were broken as though with weeping;
"you must let me go.  I will not stay and make
you wretched, as I know I should do."
</p>

<p>
"You would make me very happy, Catherine."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, Mr. Logan, you are too great,
too high for me; I cannot reach to you.  I
should tire myself and you with my efforts to be
good.  Oh, you must let me go!  I must be
free! indeed, indeed, I must be free!"
</p>

<p>
"Then go, my wild bird, and take my blessing
with you; only&mdash;" but here the tones were too
low to be distinguished; only as Queenie moved
away a figure brushed past her, and glided down
the garden path.
</p>

<p>
It was Cathy.

  "Even her little mirror<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bore witness to the change;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was something; new and strange.<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Cara, Dr. Stewart has come to see you."
</p>

<p>
It was Faith who spoke.  It was the afternoon
after Miss Cosie's tea party, and she had
met her old acquaintance down the village and
had brought him in at his solicitation to see her
sisters.  Matters were not quite satisfactory
to-day.  Faith had had a sleepless night after her
excitement, and a racking headache had been
the consequence.  And Miss Charity had been
in one of her trying moods.  A fresh access of
pain made her exacting and irritable.  Faith's
nervousness and pale looks met with scant
sympathy.  "If you were not quite so fond of
gadding about and leaving other people to do
your work you would not be so tired," was
the severe comment; the truth being, that
poor Miss Charity was having a bad time of it,
and had missed Faith's soft voice and gentle
manipulations.
</p>

<p>
It did not improve matters when Miss Hope
came to the rescue, and took the book out of her
sister's unwilling hands.  "There, Faith, run
along and put on your bonnet and get some air;
I will read to Charity," she said, in her brusque,
kindly way, and settled herself vigorously to
her task; and Faith, who knew how Cara hated
Hope's reading, hesitated and lingered, and then
finally yielded to the temptation of the fresh air
and sunshine.
</p>

<p>
It was a little trying that at this moment she
should meet Dr. Stewart.
</p>

<p>
At thirty-five a sleepless night is no beautifier,
one lacks youth's cosmetiques then.  Faith knew
her heavy half-extinguished eyes had black rings
round them.  The face under the close little
Quaker bonnet looked older and more worn than
it had last night.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Miss Faith? we can see
each other more clearly than we could last
evening.  Well, we have neither of us grown
younger," and Dr. Stewart scrutinized his pale
companion with the utmost composure.
</p>

<p>
Faith glanced at him rather timidly; his
manner troubled her, it was more brusque, a
little rougher than it used to be.  The shy young
doctor had seen the world since then.  Dr. Stewart
certainly looked a little different this
afternoon.  He was much older and stouter than
she had thought him yesterday; his whiskers
were iron-grey, and his face had a brown,
weather-beaten aspect, and the lines round the mouth
were a trifle hard and sarcastic.  She could see
him more clearly than in Miss Cosie's dim
room.
</p>

<p>
"You find me changed too, I dare say," he
continued abruptly, reading her thoughts more
shrewdly than of old.  "You see I have knocked
about the world for the last seven or eight years,
and that makes a man old before his time."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think you look particularly old, Dr. Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"Well, forty is not exactly patriarchal," somewhat
sarcastically.  "On the whole I think I am
rather proud of my grey hairs, they make me
more important.  You ought to have kept
younger, Miss Faith, leading this quiet pastoral
life of yours; you have not had all the hard hits
and thumps that fate has dealt me."
</p>

<p>
"I think inaction is sometimes more trying,"
she answered faintly, for this absence of sympathy
fretted her; and just then they met Cathy
walking down the road with free easy gait, and
carrying a basket of poppies and wild flowers.
She nodded to them hurriedly and passed on.
Dr. Stewart looked after her.
</p>

<p>
"That is a fine girl with a fine character, I will
be bound," he said, "but I think I admire Miss
Marriott more; I like her soft brunette coloring,
and then she has such splendid eyes.  Is that
fine fellow, young Clayton, rather smitten with
her?"
</p>

<p>
"I think, I am almost sure, that he cares for
some one else; at least, one never knows,"
putting up her hand to her head.
</p>

<p>
"No, one never knows; there is a fate in
these things, I believe.  That elder Miss Clayton
looks very worn, a story there I expect; most
unmarried women have had their story,&mdash;one can
read it in their faces,&mdash;and men too, for that
matter.  There is a skeleton in every one's
cupboard they say.  At forty we begin to wonder
if life's worth having after all.  Well, well, you
have a headache, I see; this sunshine is making
it worse.  If you will allow me I will see you
home and call on your sisters."
</p>

<p>
"They are all at home; they will be very
glad to see you," she stammered, but her heart
sank within her.
</p>

<p>
It was one of Cara's bad days, she might not
receive him graciously; and then what would
Dr. Stewart think of their humble little
household?  She was absent and nervous all the
rest of the way.  No wonder he found her
changed.
</p>

<p>
"Cara, Dr. Stewart has come to see you," she
said, in a deprecating voice, as though she were
committing some solecism.
</p>

<p>
Miss Hope put down her book with a start,
and Miss Charity looked up sharply from her
knitting.  "Whom did you say, Faith?" in an
inflexible voice.
</p>

<p>
"An old hospital friend of hers, one of ten
years' standing," observed Dr. Stewart, throwing
himself into the breach with military promptness.
In a moment he recognized the position; his
shrewd, observant glance took in the little parlor
and the occupants in a trice.
</p>

<p>
It was not a very attractive scene to a man of
the world; the details were homely and
uninteresting.  The bay window with its geraniums
and fuchsias; the sharp little bright-eyed woman
with her high cheek-bones and thin curls; Miss
Hope, vigorous and loud-voiced; and Miss
Prudence's ungainly figure hovering in the
background.  Faith, with her pale face and grey dress,
looked like a soft speck of shadow in the
sunlight.  Dr. Stewart's masculine breadth and
freedom of movement seemed to fill up the little
room.
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Stewart! have we ever heard of him,
sister?" asked Miss Charity, a little sarcastically,
and appealing to Miss Hope.
</p>

<p>
"If you have I dare say you have forgotten it;
ten years is a long time for ladies' memories.  I
was house-surgeon in the hospital at Carlisle,
where your sister worked."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" responded Miss Charity, dryly.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Stewart's eyes twinkled at the sight of
Faith's despondent face; he was quite master of the
position.  Miss Charity's cool reception did not
daunt him in the least.  He placed himself
leisurely by the side of the little square couch, and
eyed its occupant curiously; he turned over the
books that were piled on the narrow table beside
her, and read their titles one after another, and
then he began to talk.  How he talked!  Faith's
downcast face brightened; after a time she
became less nervous.  Dr. Stewart did not address
himself to her, he seemed to ignore her existence
completely.  He talked to Charity, who let her
knitting fall out of her hot, dry fingers as she
listened; to Miss Hope, sitting there erect and
open-eyed; even to poor, grim Miss Prudence,
to whom few people talked.  Faith raised her
soft eyes every now and then in surprise; she
had no idea Dr. Stewart was such a clever,
well-read man; his brusqueness did not jar on her
now.  To judge by his conversation he might
have read half the books that were written.  He
swallowed up Miss Charity's little modicum of
information in a moment, and left her high and
dry, with all her long sentences unsaid.  Miss
Hope gasped and said, "There, now, would you
have believed it!" to the stock of choice
anecdotes with which he regaled them.  Never were
four maiden ladies so well entertained on a
summer's afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Even Miss Prudence, the most rigid of housekeepers,
counted over her scanty store of preserves
mentally, and decided to ask him to tea.  Faith
almost held her breath for the next moment; but
Dr. Stewart accepted the invitation with alacrity.
While the tea was brewing and Miss Prudence
hunted out a remnant of rich cake, he drew his
chair a little closer to Miss Charity, and
questioned her somewhat minutely on the subject of
her accident.
</p>

<p>
"You suffer, of course, a great deal?  It is a
complicated case, I fear."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I have had my share of pain," she
answered cheerfully.  The sharp angles had
relaxed now.
</p>

<p>
"And your prospect of ease is small?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well! it might be worse," she returned
resignedly; and somehow the restless bright
eyes and thin ringlets were less repellant to him.
"I have bad times and good times, and have to
lie here and make the best of it.  We need to
have broken wills, Dr. Stewart."
</p>

<p>
"Cara is so very patient," interposed Faith,
leaning over her sister's couch.
</p>

<p>
Miss Charity gave her an odd little push.
</p>

<p>
"No; I am dreadfully cross, and give heaps
of trouble.  One's pain gets into one's temper.
Faith's been a good girl to me all these years; I
don't know what I should have done without her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Cara! please don't speak so," whispered
poor Faith with tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was Dr. Stewart who said "Humph!" now.
He glanced curiously at the two women before
him.  Faith was considered quite a girl still by
her sisters.
</p>

<p>
"I have a temper myself; I believe every one
has, though he or she will not always own to it,"
he remarked coolly, as he placed himself by Miss
Prudence, and helped himself liberally to seed cake.
</p>

<p>
It was getting quite dark when he rose at last
to take leave.  Faith accompanied him to the door.
</p>

<p>
"Well, is your headache better? you are not
quite so pale," he asked, not unkindly, as they
stood together.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the walk and the tea has done it good,"
she answered evasively.  What if he should guess
at her sleepless night?
</p>

<p>
"I hoped I should have come in for a
compliment, and that my conversation might have
helped to charm it away.  You used not to be so
matter-of-fact, Miss Faith."
</p>

<p>
Such a rush of color answered him.  "I
wonder you recollect so long ago," she returned
somewhat unsteadily.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder at it myself.  Perhaps you have
helped to jog my memory.  Well, well, we were
young and foolish once.  So this has been your
life for the last ten years?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; just this, and nothing else," with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"No wonder you are thin, and have forgotten
how to smile.  Ten years of this sort of thing!
Well, you women beat us after all;" and then
he turned on his heel and went down the little
garden path bordered by Faith's roses.
</p>

<p>
In a very little while Dr. Stewart took up his
position in Hepshaw, and buckled to his work in
a stout, uncompromising manner that seemed
natural to him.  From his patients he reaped
golden opinions, in spite of a deeply-rooted
dislike of humbug, and a tendency to shrug his
shoulders impatiently over feminine fads and
fancies.  He was soon a general favorite.  He
was prompt and kind-hearted; in cases of real
suffering nothing could exceed his patience and
watchfulness.  People soon got over his little
brusqueness, and said openly that Dr. Stewart
was a real acquisition to the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
He had taken temporary lodgings in the village;
but report was already busy with the fact
that Juniper Lodge, Dr. Morgan's old house,
next door to the Misses Palmer, had been visited
more than once by the new surgeon.  By-and-bye
suspicion became certainty, when painters
and workmen arrived on the premises.  Soon the
forlorn exterior of Juniper Lodge began to wear
a brighter look&mdash;the old green verandah was
repainted, fresh papers and plenty of whitewash
made the dark old rooms habitable, the evergreen
shrubs were cut down or transplanted, the walks
weeded and gravelled, a van-load of furniture
made its appearance, and a tidy-looking woman
with a pleasant Scotch face, answering to the
name of Jean, took up her residence.  The next
day there was a brass plate up; and Dr. Stewart
quietly walked into the Evergreens, and
announced formally to the sisters that he was their
next-door neighbor.
</p>

<p>
"And a very pleasant neighbor too," observed
Miss Hope to her gossips; "so different to
Dr. Morgan, with that slatternly housekeeper of
his always down at heels and talking to the
postman at the gate.  That Jean must be a treasure;
it is a treat to look at her caps and aprons.  I
have been all over the house, and you could eat
your dinner off the floor, as the saying is.
Dr. Stewart drops in to see us very often; it brightens
Charity to have a good chat with him.  They
have fine long arguments sometimes, only he
always gets the best of it.  He makes a rare
commotion when he comes, for he always pulls
up the blinds and throws up the windows, though
I tell him not to expose our shabby old carpet.
He had Charity and her couch out on the lawn
the other evening; just fancy! and the poor
thing has never been out for years.  She was so
pleased and excited that we all had a cry over it,
and then he scolded us all round."
</p>

<p>
It was quite true that the arrival of Dr. Stewart
as their next-door neighbor made a
great change in the little household at the
Evergreens; the introduction of the masculine
element diffused new life and activity.  During
his brief visits, for he seldom stayed long, it was
wonderful how much Dr. Stewart contrived to
effect.  The close little parlor where Faith had
toiled over weary books or sewn long seams by
Cara's couch for ten monotonous years was a
different place now.  The obnoxious geraniums no
longer blocked up the window, there was plenty
of air and light; Faith no longer gasped with pale
cheeks in the close oppressive atmosphere.  On
fine afternoons Miss Charity's couch was wheeled
out under the apple-trees; the poor lady could
watch the butterflies glancing round her, or the
great brown bees humming round her neighbor's
hive.  Instead of Trench's 'Parables,'
or D'Aubigné's 'Reformation,' suspicious green
volumes in certain standard editions lay beside
her.  Faith had no need to stifle hardly-to-be-repressed
yawns over Kingsley's 'Hypatia,' or
'Two Years Ago.'  'Laura Doone' and Black's
'Adventures of a Phaeton' held them enchained
for hours.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid our tastes are demoralized, we
are getting very lax and dissipated over our
reading.  It is very nice, but there is no method
in it," sighed Miss Charity.
</p>

<p>
"You have had solids for ten years, now your
digestion needs a lighter form of nourishment;
all work and no play dulls the brain as well as
poor Jack," returned Dr. Stewart decidedly.  He
had come in for one of his brief, business-like
visits; he was always dropping in somewhere, at
the Vicarage, at Church-Stile House, at Elderberry
Lodge, even at the Sycamores, where comely
Mrs. Morris with her seven olive branches lived.
He did not favor Brierwood Cottage often with
his visits, but he constantly met Queenie going
to and from her school, and walked beside her in
animated conversation.
</p>

<p>
Faith met them sometimes as she went about
her charitable errands among the cottages; she
would turn a little pale and pass on somewhat
hurriedly.  Dr. Stewart never stopped her on
these occasions; he would go on with his talk,
casting shrewd kindly glances under the girl's
shady straw hat.  Poor Faith would look at them
wistfully, with a shy, deprecating smile; she would
have a certain sinking of heart for hours
afterwards.  "He admires her, I knew he would," she
would say to herself a little sadly.
</p>

<p>
Poor Miss Faith! it may be doubted if this
revival of an old intimacy were a source of
unalloyed pleasure.  True, the changeless monotony of
her days was broken up; but the new interest
and excitement had their draw-backs.
</p>

<p>
Time, after its usual kindly fashion, had to a
certain extent healed her wound; the passionate
yearning of ten years ago had merged into sad
serenity.  Faith treasured the remembrance of
those few fleeting months, as women will
treasure their one romance; those unfinished
hopes and fears were buried tenderly in her
breast.  She had ceased to suffer, but she had not
ceased to remember; the sacred impression had
stamped her whole life.
</p>

<p>
And now, when the freshness of youth had
passed, she had met her ideal again; but was the
girl's ideal likely to be the woman's reality? did
she fully recognize in Dr. Stewart the dark
young surgeon in that Carlisle hospital, whose
soft looks and words had won her heart?
</p>

<p>
Faith winced secretly at these questions, as
she did at Dr. Stewart's brusque remarks.  His
experience, his knowledge of the world, his
laxity and breadth of church views, daunted the
simple woman; once or twice his roughness of
argument hurt her.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I am a poor creature!" she said to him
once.  "I am not one of the clever ones, like you
and Cara."
</p>

<p>
"No; you are only so so, Miss Faith; your
knowledge of the world is not in any way
remarkable; you are not one of the strong-minded
women," with a little dry chuckle, with which
he would conclude his remarks.
</p>

<p>
But, though he hurt and disappointed her,
there were times when a sudden softening of
voice or look brought back the past with strange
vividness.  Now and then he let fall a word that
showed that he too had not forgotten, some
chance allusion to old scenes, some memory of
her tastes.  "Ah, you used to like this, Miss
Faith," or some such speech, that brought a flush
of pleasure to her face.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Stewart looked very benign as he glanced
at the homely group before him on the afternoon
in question.
</p>

<p>
"This is better than twenty feet by eighteen
of stuffiness," he said in his concise way.
</p>

<p>
The sisterhood were all gathered on the lawn.
Miss Charity's favorite&mdash;an enormous tabby&mdash;was
purring underneath the old scarlet wrapper;
Miss Hope's knitting-needles clicked busily; Miss
Patience was occupied over some silk patch-work,
the little squares and diamonds shone in the
sunlight; Faith was reading aloud 'Westward
Ho.'  She put down the book with a bright,
welcoming smile.  The interest of the story had
moved her, her eyes shone with soft, serious
excitement; there was a scent of tall white lilies.
Dr. Stewart's bees were humming noisily; a light
wind stirred the long grass shadows; Miss
Charity's curls were in disorder.  Some fine
white-heart cherries hung over Dr. Stewart's head; he
commenced gathering some, "by way of dessert,"
he said coolly as he transferred them to his own
pocket.  "Why did they not call you Cherry,
Miss Charity, instead of that affected Cara?"
</p>

<p>
"It is only one of Faith's whims," returned
Miss Hope; "neither Prue nor I ever use it;
she begun it as a child and never left off."
</p>

<p>
"Why should I not use it, it is far softer and
prettier than Charity?" interposed Faith
appealingly.  Dr. Stewart gave one of his dry laughs.
</p>

<p>
"Every one has a right to their own fancies.  I
am prosaic enough to dislike pet names.  Cara,
when one is christened Charity!" with a
contemptuous shrug; "why, it is a direct snub to
one's sponsors."
</p>

<p>
Faith looked uncomfortable; she always did
when Dr. Stewart was in one of his quizzical
moods.  At such times he was given to find fault
with everything.  But in another moment he
became serious.
</p>

<p>
"What an odd fancy that was of Chester's
calling his little girl Nan.  She is a pretty little
creature, and her father seems to dote on her.  I
was over there yesterday; Mrs. Chester had one of
her attacks."
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing!" sighed Miss Charity, "she is
very delicate.  People are fond of calling her
fanciful, and no doubt she is full of whimsies
like the rest of us; but it is hard work having an
ailing body and an ailing temper too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he assented; "she has her share of
trouble, but she has got the blessing of a good
husband."  But here Miss Prudence shook her
head grimly.  She rarely joined in the conversation
if a stranger were present; and, as her
remarks were generally of a lugubrious nature, they
were not greatly missed.
</p>

<p>
"An ill-assorted couple, doctor," smoothing her
black mittens with sad satisfaction.  Miss
Prudence was much given to expatiate in the domestic
circle on the evils of matrimony, and to thank
Heaven that she and her three sisters had not
fallen into the hands of the Philistines; a
peculiarly happy state of resignation for an
unattractive woman, with a rigid and cast-iron
exterior, and endowed besides with a masculine
appendage of the upper lip.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" grunted the doctor laconically;
for he had an ill-concealed antagonism to Miss
Prudence, and disliked gossiping about his
patients' affairs.
</p>

<p>
"If we were to add up all the ill-assorted
marriages in the world, the sum would last us a
long time," observed Miss Hope philosophically.
</p>

<p>
"Right, my dear madam," was the brisk
answer; "but 'if folk, won't suit themselves
properly it is not other people's fault,' as the
old clerk said when&mdash;when the wrong couple
got married."
</p>

<p>
"They say marriages are made in heaven,"
began Miss Charity, a little sentimentally; but
Dr. Stewart interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
"They say so; but don't you think there is a
good deal of human bungling and obstinacy at
the bottom?  One can't fancy the angels, for
example, taking a very great interest in a
<i>marriage de convenance</i>, or a ceremony where
title-deeds and money-bags play too prominent a part!
I have seen something of human nature, Miss
Charity, and have often found occasion for
astonishment at the sad mess men, and women
too, make over their lives."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think women are often to blame,"
observed Faith in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Humph! so that is your experience," with an
odd, inexplicable look as he rose from the grass.
"Well, ladies, this is vastly entertaining, and one
could learn a good deal, no doubt; but there is
work waiting for me in the shape of Jemmy
Bates' broken leg, which, by-the-bye, Miss Faith,
is progressing most favorably," and, with a
benevolent nod that included them all, Dr. Stewart
walked off, still munching his cherries.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
A few days after Dr. Stewart's garden visit
Emmie came running up the gravel walk at
Brier wood Cottage with a frightened face.
Queenie, who was sitting in the porch as usual,
put down her work rather hurriedly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queen, I do think something is the matter.
Mr. Chester is coming up this way, and he
has got Nan in his arms, and she looks so odd;
I am sure she is ill or something."
</p>

<p>
"Is he bringing her here, or to Church-Stile
House?" asked her sister anxiously; but as she
spoke Mr. Chester's tall figure came into sight.
In another moment there was a click of the little
gate, and he came rapidly up to them carrying
his child.
</p>

<p>
"May I come in, Miss Marriott? the sun is so
hot I dare not go up the lane;" and, as Queenie
nodded and made room for him to pass into their
cool little sitting-room, he continued in an
agitated voice, "I do not know what ails Nan, she
has been sleepy and quiet for a long time, and
just now she turned very sick and poorly."
</p>

<p>
He had placed himself in the low chair by the
window as he spoke, and Queenie knelt down by
him and examined the child.  As she untied the
large white sun-bonnet Nan shrank from her
rather restlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Nan did want to go home, father; Nan very
sick," she answered, hiding her face on his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"That is what she keeps saying over and over
again," he continued, still more anxiously.  "She
was quite well when we left home this morning;
she and her little maid were chasing each other
along the lanes, pelting each other with poppies.
I thought she was only tired and wanted to be
carried; I can't understand this sickness and
drowsiness all at once.  Do you think, Miss
Marriott, that it could possibly be a sunstroke?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; her eyes certainly look very
odd," returned Queenie in great perplexity.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, father!  Nan is so very tired," moaned
the little creature again, creeping closer to his
broad breast.  "Ellen did say it was naughty to
eat the pretty currants; but Nan is good now,
only so sick."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any pain, my darling?" he asked,
bending over her.
</p>

<p>
"No; no pain, only Nan so tired," she repeated,
in the most pathetic voice.  Mr. Chester looked
appealingly at Queenie.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid she is very ill," she returned
reluctantly, for there was a strange look about
the child that alarmed her.  "Emmie dear, tell
Patience to go and fetch Dr. Stewart at once,
and you run across for Langley."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, we must have Langley," he repeated
helplessly, looking down at his pet.  Nan had
left off her moaning and seemed sinking into
drowsiness.
</p>

<p>
"Will she let me undress her and lay her in
Emmie's bed? she will be more comfortable than
in your arms;" but, as Nan stirred uneasily and
murmured "Father; Nan cannot leave father,"
Mr. Chester was obliged to carry her up himself.
But even when he placed her on the cool pillow
she still held his hand tightly.
</p>

<p>
"Father will not leave his pet; don't be
afraid, my darling."
</p>

<p>
When Langley arrived she found him still
hanging over the child.  Nan seemed sleeping;
her dark eyelashes swept her cheek; one small
hand was folded in her father's.
</p>

<p>
"This sleep will do her good.  It must have
been the sun that made her feel sick," he said,
looking up at Langley with a relieved expression.
Langley put back the long silky hair from the
child's forehead, but did not answer.  Some chill
presentiment for which she could not account
had seized her at the moment of Emmie's
summons; and then, why did not Nan move
when she kissed her?
</p>

<p>
"I do not think this looks quite like sleep,
like natural sleep, I mean.  I think we ought to
try to rouse her, at least till Dr. Stewart comes.
Speak to her, Harry; she has never slept so
soundly before."
</p>

<p>
"Nan, Nan, my little one, father wants you,"
but, for the first time in her infant life, Nan was
deaf to her father's voice.
</p>

<p>
"What can we do? what are we to do?  Dr. Stewart
will not be home for another hour,"
exclaimed Queenie, now really terrified.  No
suspicion of the truth had entered into any of
their minds.  Only when it was too late did the
child's speech about the pretty currants recur to
her.
</p>

<p>
The next two hours that passed were never
effaced from Queenie's memory.  No efforts of
theirs could rouse the child from the death-like
stupor that oppressed her.  Langley had tried
two or three remedies, but they were unavailing,
and the father's agony was pitiable to witness.
The little town was fairly roused, and messengers
on horseback were scouring the neighbourhood
after Dr. Stewart.  But he had gone to a
farmhouse some five miles distant, and delay was
inevitable.  Garth and Ted had each gone in
different directions, and Faith Palmer had driven
over to Karldale to tell Mrs. Chester the reason
of her husband's long absence.
</p>

<p>
It was just before Dr. Stewart's arrival that
Langley, examining the child's clothes, found
some dark crimson stains on the front of the
little white frock, and showed them to the doctor,
as he stood with a grave face looking down at
the child.  A very brief survey had satisfied
him.
</p>

<p>
"Humph! it is just as I feared when young
Clayton told me the symptoms.  She has been
eating deadly night-shade.  Children sometimes
mistake them for currants.  Why was she allowed
to run about without her nurse?"
</p>

<p>
"She had the girl with her," returned the
poor father, and here he uttered a strong
expletive; but Langley laid her hand on his arm and
said Hush!  "What can you do to wake her,
Dr. Stewart?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," returned the doctor sadly.  "An
hour or two sooner and I could have saved her.
But, my good sir, these things are not in our
hands.  It is neither your fault nor mine that I
was not here."
</p>

<p>
"You can do nothing!" turning upon him
almost fiercely in his despair, as though he would
wrest the child's life from him by force.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," he repeated emphatically, for it
was best that the miserable father should realize
the truth at once, and not cling to the shadow of
a hope.  "The child is sleeping herself to death;
in a few hours it must all be over."
</p>

<p>
"Try to bear it, Harry," said Langley, in her
low, soothing voice, for the strong man absolutely
staggered under the blow.  Her face was almost
as white as his as she guided him to a chair, but
he turned from her with a groan and hid his face
in the child's pillow.
</p>

<p>
"I will come again; there is nothing for me
to do here," said Dr. Stewart.  His voice was
rough, probably with emotion, as he turned away
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"An hour or two earlier and I could have
saved her," he said to Queenie as she followed
him down-stairs.  "It goes hard with a man to
know that, and that he can do absolutely nothing;
just because my mare wanted shoeing, and I
went out of the beaten track.  There is another
life gone, that is what I call a mystery," and
Dr. Stewart muttered his favorite "humph!" and
went away with a sorrowful face, for he was
soft-hearted, and loved all children for their own
sweet sakes.
</p>

<p>
There was literally nothing to be done after
this.  Garth came in by-and-bye and paid a
short visit to the room up-stairs, but he did not
stay long.
</p>

<p>
"Langley is with him, and we have sent for
his wife.  There is nothing that a fellow can do,
and&mdash;in short, I can't stand it," he blurted out
confidentially to Queenie, with a man's instinctive
horror of scenes.  "If there were something that
one could do; but in these sort of cases women
are the best.  It cuts one to the heart to see him
going on like that;" and Garth turned on his
heel abruptly, and walked to the window.
</p>

<p>
But he made himself of use too in that troubled
little household; for he succeeded in coaxing
Emmie, who was sobbing with nervous excitement,
to go with him to Church-Stile House, and
promised Queenie to place her under Cathy's care
for the night.  This was a great relief to Queenie,
who had reason to dread any of these sort of
depressing scenes for her, and left her free for any
duty that might devolve on her.
</p>

<p>
A sad sight awaited her up-stairs.  The setting
sun was flooding the little chamber, and the last
dazzling rays shone full on the face of the child.
Mr. Chester was kneeling by the bed, with one
little hand hidden in his; Langley, with a white,
rigid face, was standing beside him.  As the
hoarse uncontrollable sobs, those tearless sobs of
a strong man, smote on her ear she shivered and
shrank back as though some blow were dealt her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queenie, this is dreadful!  Who can
comfort him?  Where is his wife and the
mother of his child?" she whispered, as the girl
went up to them.  "It is she who ought to be
here, not I."
</p>

<p>
"We have sent for her.  Hush, Langley, he
will hear you."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, he bears nothing; he will have it that
she will wake and speak to him."  But her words
reached his ear.
</p>

<p>
"She will, Langley; how can you be so cruel?
They always do just before&mdash;&mdash;" "the last," he was
going to say, but the words choked him.  "You
will say good-bye to father, and give him one
sweet kiss, will you not, my little Nan, my
darling, my treasure?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Harry, try to bear it!  Harry, Harry,
won't you listen to me a moment?" and Langley
laid her cold hand on his arm; but her touch
only seemed to make him more frantic.
</p>

<p>
"No, I will not bear it; I cannot bear it.
Have I not suffered enough?  Will God take
from me my only comfort?  Oh, my little child,
my little child!" with another burst of anguish.
</p>

<p>
"See how calm and peaceful she looks," she
went on, in her quiet, controlling voice, but her
face was like marble; "just sleeping peacefully
into her rest; no pain, no suffering.  It is so 'He
giveth His beloved sleep;' try and think of that,
Harry."
</p>

<p>
"She was my ewe lamb," he muttered,
gloomily; "she drank of my cup, and lay in my
bosom.  She was my own little daughter, my
only one, She used to kneel up upon my knees
and say her pretty prayers to me every night,
the darling.  'God bless Nan and Nan's father,'
she always said that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and He will bless you, my poor Harry."
</p>

<p>
"Is it blessing me to rob me like this of my
all?  Oh, Langley, pray to Him; you are a good
woman; pray both of you that she may be spared
to me."
</p>

<p>
"Ab, if it were only His will!" sighed Langley.
Did the memory of those strange pathetic words
of another heart-broken father cross her memory?
"'While the child was yet alive, I fasted and
wept; for I said, Who can tell whether God will
be gracious to me, that the child may live?'  Ah,
if it were only His will!"
</p>

<p>
"Hush! did you see her stir?  I saw her, I
felt her; she is waking now.  Nan, my pet, my
darling, open your sweet eyes and look at
father."  But, alas, the little inanimate form
still lay in its deathly torpor.
</p>

<p>
And so the hours passed.  Dr. Stewart came
and went again; and Garth stole up the
uncarpeted stairs, and stood outside with bated
breath, to listen if a further change had taken
place.  But still Mr. Chester knelt beside the
little white bed, and Langley and Queenie kept
faithful watch beside him.
</p>

<p>
It was long past midnight when Queenie,
laying her hand on the child's brow, felt it cold
beneath her touch, and knew that the last feeble
breath had been drawn, and signed to Langley
that all was over.
</p>

<p>
But even then the unhappy father would not
realize the truth; and when at last it dawned
upon him, he bade them with passionate
impatience to leave him there with his dead.
"Leave me alone with my child; she belongs to
me; she is mine;" and as they went out sadly
they could hear him groan, "Oh, my little Nan,
my little, little child."
</p>

<p>
As they left the room, Queenie could hear
Garth calling to her in a suppressed voice, and
at once went down to him.  He took hold of her
hand, and led her into the cheery little parlor.
There was a bright fire in the grate; an old
wooden rocking-chair stood near it; the tea-tray
was on the round black table where the sisters
ate their simple meals.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down there and warm yourself," he said,
kindly, "and I will give you a cup of tea.
Where is Langley?"
</p>

<p>
"She went into my room; I think she wants
to be alone; I will go up to her presently.  Oh,
Mr. Clayton," bursting into tears, for this touch
of thoughtfulness moved her from her enforced
calmness, "it has been so sad, so dreadful, all
these hours."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I know it has been very hard upon
you.  Poor Chester, and poor dear little Nan;
who would have dreamed of such a catastrophe?
Even Dr. Stewart, who is inured to all sorts of
painful scenes, seems quite upset by it.  It must
be hard for a man to lose his only child,"
continued Garth, gravely, as he brought the tea,
and stirred the fire into a more cheerful blaze.
</p>

<p>
"I did not know you were here," she said,
after an interval of silence.  The warmth had
revived her, and the flow of nervous tears had
done her good.  How she wished that Langley
could be induced to come down too!
</p>

<p>
"I could not make up my mind to leave you
all in such a strait.  Langley was here, and I
thought after all that I might be of use.  I am
glad I thought of keeping up the fire.  I had a
grand hunt for Patience's tea-caddy; it took me
no end of time to find."
</p>

<p>
Garth was talking in a fast, nervous way to
keep up his own and Queenie's spirits.  He had
never seen her cry before, and it gave him an
odd sort of pain.  The thought of the room
upstairs, and of the heart-broken father kneeling
there by his dead child, weighed upon them both
like lead; only Queenie stretched out her cold
hands to the blaze, and drank her tea obediently,
and felt cheered by Garth's kindness.
</p>

<p>
"These sorts of things upset one's views of
life," he continued, after a pause.  "I suppose we
all know trouble in some shape or other; but
when it comes to a man losing his only bit of
comfort, and Heaven only knows what that child
was to the poor fellow&mdash;well, I can only say it
does seem hard."
</p>

<p>
"That is what I felt when I thought I was
going to lose Emmie.  Mr. Chester has his wife."
</p>

<p>
"She has never been much good to him.  I
am no scandal-monger, but one can't help seeing
that.  I wonder what has become of her and
Miss Faith?" he went on, restlessly, walking to
the window and looking out on the dark summer
night.
</p>

<p>
Queenie left him soon after that.  "She must
see after Langley," she said; "and there were
other things that ought to be done," she added,
with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
Garth let her go with some reluctance; the
little parlor looked desolate without her.  He sat
down in the old rocking-chair after she had left,
and fell into an odd, musing dream.  "How
strangely they seemed to be drawn together,"
he thought.  He was as much at home with
her as he was with Langley and Cathy; it
had come quite naturally to him now to take
her under his protection, and care for her as
he did for them.  It had been pleasant ministering
to her comfort just now.  How pretty she
had looked sitting there in her black dress, with
her head resting against the hard wood of the
chair.  Most women looked ugly when they cried,
but her tears had flowed so quietly.  And then
he wondered how Dora looked when she cried,
and if she would ever gaze up in his face as
gently and gratefully as Queenie did just now.
And then he fell to musing in a grave,
old-fashioned way on the inequalities of matrimony,
and the probable risk of disappointment.  Things
did not always turn out well, as poor Chester had
found to his cost.  In times of trouble a man
must turn for comfort to his wife.  Was Dora the
one likely to yield him this comfort?  She was
very strong and reliable; all manner of good
qualities were hers, besides her creamy skin and
golden hair; but would she be gentle and soft
with him at times when a man needed gentleness?
</p>

<p>
Garth was disquieting himself a little over
these thoughts while Queenie stole up the little
staircase.  All was quiet in Emmie's room as she
passed; her own was chill and dark as she entered
it.  Langley had not lighted the candle; she was
sitting by the open window looking out at the
black, starless night.  The rain was falling now,
the drops were pattering on the creeper.  Queenie
gave a little shiver of discomfort at the dreary
scene, and thought regretfully of the rocking-chair
downstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been in again, Langley?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but he will not let me stay or do anything
for him; he wants her all to himself for a
little, he says.  He just let me put things a little
comfortable, and as they should be, watching me
jealously all the time, and then I came away.
Garth must go in by-and-bye, and coax him down."
</p>

<p>
Langley spoke in a tone of forced composure,
but her breath was labored, and the hand that
touched Queenie's was so damp and cold that the
girl absolutely started.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Langley, all this is making you quite
ill.  Do come down with me; your brother has
lighted a fire, and it is so warm and cosy, and
we can talk ever so much better there."  But
Langley refused.
</p>

<p>
"No, no; I must stop here as long as he is
shut up in that room.  What do I want with
warmth and comfort while he is
suffering&mdash;suffering? and I can do nothing for
him&mdash;nothing, nothing!" in a voice of such despair
that Queenie started.  A new light seemed
breaking on her.
</p>

<p>
"He asked for you directly, before his wife
was sent for, I know.  I think he likes you to be
with him, Langley; you are old friends, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I know.  He called me to him just
now, and we stood together for a long time
looking down at the child.  His eyes asked me for
comfort; but what consolation had I to give him?
His wife ought to be there, not I; we both knew
that; and then he sent me away."
</p>

<p>
"But you need not have gone."
</p>

<p>
"Could I have stood there taking her place
when I know too well what we have been to each
other?  He was right to send me away, and I
was right to go; but oh, Queenie, this night is
killing me!" and Langley leant against her so
heavily, and her voice sounded so strangely in
the darkness, that Queenie was frightened.  If
she guessed rightly, what utter misery there was
locked up in this woman's breast!
</p>

<p>
"You must lie down on my bed; I will not
talk to you like this," she said, firmly.  And when
Langley, faint and exhausted with emotion,
offered no resistance, she fetched a thick shawl
and folded it round her, and then lighted a
candle and administered some sal-volatile.  The
dim light showed a very ghastly face, and great
bright eyes brimful of wretchedness; the
somewhat thin lips were trembling with weakness.
</p>

<p>
"Don't look at me, Queenie; don't let me talk.
I am not myself to-night; I shall say things I
ought not to say."  But Queenie only kissed her
tenderly, and drew the white face down to her
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Do talk, Langley; it will do you good.  You
have kept it all in too long, and it has done you
harm.  No one wants me, and I can sit beside
you a little.  When I hear the least movement
in Emmie's room I will go in."
</p>

<p>
"We ought not to leave him long alone," she
answered, faintly.  "Garth must go in to him
presently.  He would mind me, I know; but I
dare not let him see me like this.  Oh, Queenie,
whatever sorrow you may have to bear, may you
never know mine&mdash;to bring trouble on the man
you love, and then not to be able to comfort
him!"
</p>

<p>
Queenie stroked her hair softly; there was
sympathy conveyed in every touch.  "Tell me
all about it, Langley," she whispered; "I always
knew you had a grief.  If you loved Mr. Chester,
and he cared for you, why did you not marry
him?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, indeed!  I have had five years in
which to ask myself that question.  I loved him,
of course.  We had grown up together; as long as
I could remember, Harry and I had been together
caring for each other.  Garth, every one, expected
how it would be."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they all took it too much as a matter
of course."
</p>

<p>
"How did you know that?" lifting her head
from Queenie's shoulder.  "No one can have
told you.  I never had any confidant."
</p>

<p>
"One guesses things by instinct sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"You are young to know human nature so
well," sinking back with a sigh.  "Ah, six years
ago I was like Cathy&mdash;proud, impulsive, and
loving my own will.  I had a great notion of
independence.  I thought women were not
allowed enough liberty, that they held
themselves too cheaply; and though I loved Harry,
I was not quite willing to marry him."
</p>

<p>
"That sounds strange.  I can hardly imagine
you like Cathy."
</p>

<p>
"No; my self-will is broken now; I have
expiated my girlish failings too bitterly.  One's
spirit dies under such an ordeal.  But though I
blame myself, not him, I think a stronger nature
would have controlled me."
</p>

<p>
"Did you refuse him then?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I did.  He came to me one day;
things had been going on for a long time, but
there had been no actual wooing.  Harry was a
matter-of-fact man, and I was just the reverse.
I had got my head full of novels, and had framed
my own ideas of love-making.  I wanted an
ardent lover, one who would carry me away with
the force of his own feelings.  The quiet,
business-like manner in which Harry spoke fired my
pride and resolved me; besides, as I said before,
that though I loved him, I was not quite willing
to be married."
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember what he said to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; his very words.  I was in the drawing-room
at Church-Stile House, and he came to me
looking very quiet and pale.  'Langley,' he said,
'this has been going on a long time, too long,
Garth and I think, and I don't seem to be any
nearer to what I wish.  We care for each other, I
know.  Can you not make up your mind to be
my wife?  Karldale Grange is waiting for its
mistress.'  Just that; not a word of his love for
me, not a single protestation."
</p>

<p>
"I think it was very honest and straight-forward."
</p>

<p>
"Can you guess how I answered him?  I
thanked him coldly, and said that I was in no
mood for marrying, that I was not sure that I
should ever marry; I cared too much for my
freedom.
</p>

<p>
"'Have you been playing with me all these
years, Langley?' he said, sadly, and his face grew
so white.  'I can hardly believe that.  I will
not press or annoy you, dear; I will speak to
Garth;' and then he went away.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if he had only stayed, Queenie, and
reasoned with me a little, my better nature must
have prevailed, for I loved him so; but his
apparent coolness angered me, and then Garth came
and scolded me, which made matters worse.  He
was for carrying things with a high hand; but I
only grew obstinate.  And so one wretched day
Harry and I had bitter words together, and he
faced round upon me when I sat pretending to
work, and swore that if I would not marry him,
Gertrude Leslie should; and with that he turned
on his heel and left me.
</p>

<p>
"I felt I had gone too far then, and that he
meant what he said.  Sooner than lose him
altogether, I would have humiliated myself in the
dust.  I threw down my work, and called out
Harry, but he did not hear, and in another moment
his horse's hoofs sounded in the lane.
</p>

<p>
"I did all then that I could do.  I wrote a
penitent little note begging him to forgive me,
and come back to me, and all should be as he
wished; and I sent a messenger on to Karldale
with it, charging him to deliver it into Harry's
own hands; but, alas, it was brought back to me
unopened.  Harry had never been home at all,
he had ridden straight off to Blanddale; and the
next morning I heard Gertrude Leslie had
promised to be his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Queenie," as the girl leant over her and
kissed the white lips that quivered still with the
remembrance of that long-past agony, "that
moment was a sufficient punishment for all my
mad folly; even Garth thought so, for he had no
word of reproach for me.
</p>

<p>
"But I opened my lips to no one.  None knew
what I suffered daring those nights and days.
An old aunt of ours had fallen ill in Carlisle, and
I went to her, and stayed with her till she died.
</p>

<p>
"When I came back they were married, and
by-and-bye Harry and I met.  I could see he was
greatly changed, and his manner was constrained
and nervous; but it was not in his nature to
bear malice, and I know he soon forgave me, all
the more that he must have seen that he was not
the only one to suffer."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Langley," stroking the worn face still
more tenderly, "I can hardly bear to hear it;
it seems all so dreadful.  I cannot understand
how women can live through such things."
</p>

<p>
"One gets used to torture," with a strange
smile.  "Have you not read that martyrs have
been known to sleep on the rack?  The worst part
of life always seems to me that pain so seldom
kills.  We go on mutilated, shorn of our best
blessings, wounded and bleeding, but we never
die."
</p>

<p>
Queenie stooped down and quoted softly in her
ear, "Wherefore is light given to him in misery,
and life unto the bitter in soul; which long for
death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
than for hid treasures?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I have often repeated those words.  I
thought when I first saw Harry after he was
married that it would kill me; to think that he
belonged to another woman, that she, not I, had
a right to his every thought and care.  It seemed
as though my heart could not hold all its pain."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but he had not ceased to love you.
There must have been some consolation in that
thought."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but it was not a right consolation; and
then I knew that I was the cause of his
unhappiness&mdash;that was the hardest part of all.  He was
so good; he tried so hard to do his duty by her,
and make her a fond and faithful husband; but
she never loved him."
</p>

<p>
"But she married him."
</p>

<p>
"Alas, she married him out of pique.  Her
lover had jilted her, and in her despair she took
the first offer that came to her.  Poor Gertrude! she
has told me all her troubles.  I am her friend
as well as Harry's, and all that can be done for
them I have tried to do to my utmost."
</p>

<p>
"That I am sure you have."
</p>

<p>
"It used to be dreadful to go there, and see
how she treated him; but it was my penance,
and I bore it for his sake.  When the child came
things were better between them, and latterly
I hoped that he had ceased to regret the past;
but now," she wrung her hands, and the
despairing look came back into her eyes, "God has
taken from him his only comfort, and I must see
his misery and do nothing."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's silence, only the ceaseless
patter of the rain sounded on the leaves, and
then Langley raised herself with effort.
</p>

<p>
"He has been too long alone; some one must
go to him," she said, anxiously.  "Either you or
Garth must rouse him."
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" interrupted Queenie; "I think I
hear something.  There is surely the sound of
wheels in the distance.  It is coming nearer;
yes, it is stopping at the gate."
</p>

<p>
"Then it must be Gertrude," exclaimed
Langley, putting back the damp hair from her
face, and trying to rise from the bed.  "Look
out, dear Queenie.  Oh, if it should be
Gertrude!"
</p>

<p>
"I am straining my eyes in the darkness, but
it is so hard to distinguish anything.  Yes, there
are two figures, one very tall.  I think that must
be Mrs. Chester.  Garth is opening the door;
now he will bring her up.  Lie down again,
Langley; you look dreadful."  But Langley
only shook her head, and renewed her efforts
to rise.
</p>

<p>
They could hear footsteps ascending the narrow
stairs.  The gleam of a candle preceded them.
Langley tottered feebly to the head of the
staircase; but Mrs. Chester did not see her.
</p>

<p>
"Where is she? where is my child?" she said,
putting out her hands and feeling before her,
with the gesture of a sleep-walker, or one stricken
suddenly blind; and Queenie, moved with sudden
compassion, sprang forward and guided her to
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Little Nan is there," she said.  "He is
sitting by her; we cannot get him to leave her."
</p>

<p>
Yes; he was sitting there in the same attitude in
which they had left him, with the child's
dead hand still clasped in his.  At the sight of
that bowed figure, that mute despair, the wife's
heart woke into sudden life, and she walked
feebly towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Harry," she said, bursting into tears, and
throwing her arms round his neck, "my poor
Harry, it is our little child; mine as well as
yours.  We must comfort each other."
</p>

CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
"I KNEW YOU WOULD BE SORRY FOR US."
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "When they see her their tears will cease to flow,<br>
  Lest they should fall on this pure pale brow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the lilies the child is holding.<br>
  With symbol flowers in stainless hand,<br>
  She goes by the great white throne to stand,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Helen Marion Burnside.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
As the door closed upon the bereaved parents,
Queenie heard a low "Thank God" behind her,
and immediately afterwards Langley crept softly
away.  When Queenie went back to her, she
found her lying on her bed shedding tears quietly.
The strained and fixed expression of her face had
relaxed; the worn nerves and brain had at last
found relief.
</p>

<p>
"Let me cry, it will do me good," she said,
when the girl would have hushed her.  "If you
only knew how long it is since I have been able
to shed a tear.  I felt as though I were turning
into stone.  But now&mdash;ah, if she will only be
good to him I think I could bear anything."
</p>

<p>
Queenie was obliged to modify her opinion of
Mrs. Chester as she watched her during the
trying hours that followed.  Whatever sins
Gertrude had committed against her husband
and child during their brief married life she felt
must be partially condoned by her present
self-forgetfulness.
</p>

<p>
It may be doubted perhaps whether she had
loved her child while it lived with a mother's
strong passion.  Certain words that little Nan
had uttered in her baby language had given a
contrary impression.  "Mammie did say, 'Go
away, Nan,'" she had observed more than once.
"Mammie always so tired when Nan looks at
her."  Might it not have been that, absorbed in
her own selfish repinings and discontent, she had
refused to gather up the sweetness of that infant
life into hers until it was too late?  That she was
suffering now, no one could doubt who looked at
her.  The father's heart might be broken within
him, but his was the agony of bereavement.  No
self-reproach festered his wound; no bitterness
of remorse was his.  But who could measure the
anguish of that unhappy mother?
</p>

<p>
Queenie watched her half fascinated as she
glided softly from place to place, a graceful,
dark-eyed woman.  The tall figure, once so full
and commanding, was attenuated and bowed as
though with weakness.  Bright patches of color
burnt on the thin cheeks: soft streaks of gray
showed in the thick coils of hair; and how low
and suffering were the once sharp, querulous
tones.
</p>

<p>
It was a mournful little household in Brierwood
Cottage.  Mr. Chester had refused to leave
the place where his child was.  Little Nan still
lay in Emmie's room.  Queenie had given up
hers, and had betaken herself to Patience's little
chamber.  Emmie was still at Church-Stile
House.
</p>

<p>
Queenie used to go out to her work, and leave
Gertrude alone with her husband.  On her return
she would see them sitting hand in hand talking
softly of their child.  Nothing but his wife's
presence seemed to console the unhappy father.
Only she or Langley could rouse him or induce
him to take food.  Once when they thought they
were alone Queenie saw Gertrude take her
husband's head between her hands and kiss it
softly, and lay it on her breast.  "Harry, my
poor Harry," she whispered over him, with a
perfect passion of pity.  Did the warning voice
within her admonish her that she too must soon
leave him and join her child?
</p>

<p>
Langley came and went on brief ministering
errands, but she never remained long.  Now and
then, when all was quiet in the little room above,
she would go in and kneel down beside the baby
coffin.  What sort of prayers ascended from that
lonely heart that had missed its way so early in
life?  "Little Nan, I would have laid down my
life to have saved yours," she whispered, pressing
her lips to the wood.
</p>

<p>
One day Captain Fawcett stood there with
Emmie beside him.  Emmie's great blue eyes
dilated and widened with awe and wonder at
the sight of the tiny white face.  The little coffin,
the bed, the room were perfectly strewn with
flowers.  Great boxes of rare hot-house flowers
sent from Carlisle, and directed in an unknown
hand, had arrived that morning at the cottage.
Gertrude was sitting weaving a cross in the room
down-stairs, while her husband watched her.
</p>

<p>
"Is that Nan? it looks like a stone angel
lying under a quilt of roses and lilies.  It is
just like a little angel that I used to see in the
cathedral," whispered Emmie.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, it is Nan; it is just as my girl looked
when her mother dressed her up for the last
time in her flowers," returned Captain Fawcett,
tremulously.  A tear rolled down his grizzled
moustache; but Emmie's eyes only widened and
grew solemn.
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity, such pretty flowers; and they
will have so many there," she continued, reflectively.
"Aren't you glad that Alice has all those
roses?  Do you know, I often dream about your
girl.  She was like me, you know, only she had
long hair.  Last night I thought she and Nan
came running to meet me; they were laughing
so, and their hands were full of roses."
</p>

<p>
"Bless your pretty fancies, my darling.  Well,
I dream of my little maid often myself, and she
always comes to me and says, 'Father.'  I can
feel her little hand slipping into mine.  And then
when I wake I am lonesome somehow.  Poor
little Ailie."
</p>

<p>
"You must not say poor," returned Emmie,
pressing heavily against his knee; "she is not
poor at all; she was very tired, you know, and
now she is rested.  Perhaps Nan would have
been tired too if she had stayed longer."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, so she might, poor lammie," with a
heavy sigh.
</p>

<p>
"The world is such a tiring place," continued
Emmie, moralizing in her quaint childish way.
"Some one is always crying in it.  If it were not
for leaving Queenie alone, I think I should like
to go too, and walk about the golden streets with
Alice and Nan; there are such lots of children
there, and it is all bright, and nobody cries and
looks sad and miserable."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go and look for blackberries: the
Missus is so fond of blackberries," interposed the
Captain, hurriedly, for Emmie's dilated eyes
filled him with alarm.  The child's sensitive
nature was depressed by the sadness that
surrounded her; a whole world of pathos, a strange
involved meaning, lay behind those simple
words.
</p>

<p>
"The world is such a tiring place; some one
is always crying in it."  Alas! yes, little Emmie.
Out of His bright heaven God looks down on
the upturned wet faces of myriads of His creatures.
What seas of tears roll between the earth
and His mercy!  If the concentrated pain of
humanity could be condensed into a single groan,
the whole universe could not bear the terror of
that sound, reverberating beyond the bound of
the uttermost stars, silencing the very music of
heaven.
</p>

<p>
Such a tiring place!  True, most true, little
Emmie.  A place where mistakes are made and
never rectified; a place where a joyous meeting
is too often replaced by a sad good-bye; where
hearts that cleave together are sundered; where
the best loved is the soonest taken; where under
the sunshine lie the shadows, and the shadows
lengthen the farther we walk.
</p>

<p>
Such a tiring place! since we must work
and weep, and live out the life that seems to us
so imperfect; since sweet blossoms fail to bring
fruit, and thorns lurk underneath the roses.  Yet
are the letters written up, graven and indelible,
on every mutilated life: "What I do thou
knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter."
</p>

<p>
So one bright summer's morning, loving hands
lifted little Nan and laid her in her resting-place
by the lime-tree walk, and the childless parents
followed hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
The churchyard was crowded with sympathizing
faces.  Queenie was there at the head of her
scholars, and Langley stood near her, leaning
heavily on her brother's arm.  When the service
was over the children stepped up two and two,
and dropped their simple offerings of rustic
wreaths and flowers into the open grave.  One
child had fashioned a rude cross of poppies and
corn, and flung it red and gleaming at the
mother's feet.  Gertrude took it up and kissed
it, and placed it tenderly with the rest.  The
child, a chubby-faced creature scarcely more than
an infant, looked up at her with great black
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oo' little gell will like my fowers," she
lisped, as Gertrude burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Queenie felt very heavy-hearted when, the
next day, the Chesters left her and went back
to their lonely home.  Gertrude kissed her, and
tried to say a few words of thanks.
</p>

<p>
"You have been a good Samaritan to me and
Harry, Miss Marriott," she said, in a broken
voice; "you have taken us in, and tried to bind
up our wounds with oil and wine, and yet you
were almost a stranger to us."
</p>

<p>
"I shall come again.  I cannot keep away
from there," added Mr. Chester, with a yearning
look towards the place where the mortal remains
of his darling were laid.  "No, I cannot thank
you, Miss Marriott, I never can do so."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hush! go away, please.  Would not any
one have done it in my place?" cried the girl,
with a little sob.  She leant against the little
gate, watching them until the phaeton was out of
sight.  Garth, who was coming down the lane,
crossed over the road and joined her.
</p>

<p>
"So you have your little home to yourself
again," he said, looking down at her kindly.
"Ah, well, it has been a miserable week to you
and to all of us.  No one can help feeling for
poor Chester; and as for that wife of his&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well!" interrupted Queenie, fixing her
strange, fathomless eyes on the young man, as
he left his sentence unfinished.  Every now and
then they startled people with their strange
haunting beauty; they startled Garth now, for
he became suddenly confused.
</p>

<p>
"All I meant was, that one can plainly see
that Mrs. Chester is not long for this world.
Stewart says so plainly, and she must be conscious
of it herself.  One can tell that there is
trouble in store for that poor fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and she has begun to love him too
late," replied Queenie.  "All these years lost,
and only to understand each other at the last;
there does seem such a mystery in things,
Mr. Clayton."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all; he has only married the wrong
woman," returned Garth, coolly; "hundreds of
men do that, and have to rue their mistake.
You are only a girl, you do not know the world
as we do," continued the young man, a little
loftily.  "There are all sorts of temptations and
influences.  One needs all one's wisdom and
strength of mind to steer clear among all the
shoals and quicksands one finds in life."
</p>

<p>
"It was Mr. Chester's own fault marrying the
wrong woman," persisted Queenie, with a little
heat.
</p>

<p>
Garth's loftiness and burst of eloquence did
not move her in the least.  His cool statement
of facts was rank heresy in her eyes.  What
was it to her that hundreds of men had made
matrimonial mistakes?  In her woman's creed,
that code of purity and innocence, it was a
simple question of right and wrong.  To love one
woman and marry another, however expedient in
a worldly point of view, was a sin for which
there was no grace of forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
"Men make their own fate; it is for them to
choose.  No one need make mistakes with their
eyes open," continued the girl, with a little
impatience and scorn of this matter-of-fact
philosophy.  "If they make a poor thing of their
own life it is not for them to complain."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you are hard on us.  You are only a
girl; you do not know," returned the young
man, looking down from the altitude of his
superior wisdom into Queenie's wide-open
indignant eyes with exasperating calmness.  "Your
life compared to ours is like a mill-stream beside
a rushing river: one is all movement; the strong
currents draw hither and thither."
</p>

<p>
"The mill-stream is often the deeper," was the
petulant answer.
</p>

<p>
Garth laughed; he was not at all discomposed
by Queenie's impatient argument.  He would
have enjoyed having it out with her if he had
had time, but, as he told himself, he had more
important business in hand.
</p>

<p>
"By-the-bye, you are making me waste my
precious moments as usual," he observed,
good-humoredly; "and I have never given you
Langley's message.  She and Cathy want you to
come up to our place this evening; they think
the cottage must be so dull now your guests have
gone."
</p>

<p>
"How kind and thoughtful of Langley!"
returned Queenie; and now the brown eyes had
a happy sparkle in them.  There was no place so
dear to her as Church-Stile House.  If Garth
could only have known it!
</p>

<p>
"You will be doing them a kindness by cheering
them up a little, as both Ted and I will be
away.  Have you heard," he continued, gravely,
"that they are rather in trouble at Crossgill
Vicarage.  I had a letter this morning from
Dora, I mean Miss Cunningham," went on Garth,
coloring a little bashfully over his mistake.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going there?  I hope there is not
much the matter," asked Queenie, in a measured
voice.  There was no sparkle now in her eyes.
The evening was to be spent without him; and
then Miss Cunningham had written to him at
the first hint of trouble.  She had sought him,
and not Langley.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, as to that, she does not say much in
her letter.  Miss Cunningham is not one to make
a fuss about anything.  It is Florence who is ill,
and she and her father mean to go over to
Brussels.  Stay, I have her note here," producing
it from his breast-pocket.  "You can judge for
yourself there is not much in it; but then Miss
Cunningham is one of the quiet sort."
</p>

<p>
Queenie took the note "a little reluctantly.
Dora wrote a large, business-like hand.  Those
firm, well-formed characters had nothing irresolute
in them.  It was curt and concise.
</p>

<p>
"Dear Mr. Clayton," it began, "my father
wishes you to know that we have had bad news
from Brussels.  Darling Flo is very ill.  Madame
Shleïfer says it is typhoid fever; but as there
are no unfavorable symptoms, there is nothing
serious to be apprehended.  One must make
allowances for Beattie's nervousness; girls of
seventeen are apt to exaggerate.  Still papa and I
cannot help feeling anxious, and we shall start
by the early train to-morrow.  If you could come
over this evening we shall be glad, as papa wants
to consult you about a little business.  The
porch-room shall be got ready for you, as I know you
will make an effort to come to us in our trouble."
</p>

<p>
"She does not say very much, but one can
read between the lines.  Florence is the youngest
sister, and her favorite.  I know she is terribly
anxious," observed Garth, as Queenie returned
the note in silence.  "Well, I must be off; my
trap will be round directly.  You three girls will
have a cosy evening without me I expect.  Good-bye
till to-morrow," and Garth touched his felt
hat and ran down the lane.
</p>

<p>
"He might have shaken hands," thought
Queenie, as she walked slowly back into the
cottage.
</p>

<p>
The empty room felt very dull, but still it
would have been better there than in Church-Stile
House without him.  On the whole, the evening
was a failure.  Cathy was in one of her quiet
moods, and could not be roused into interest
about anything.  Langley looked paler than usual,
and complained of head-ache, and Emmie was listless
and restless.  As for Queenie, she took herself
to task severely for all manner of miserable fancies
as she walked back to the cottage in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"What is the use of your perpetually crying
for the moon?" she said indignantly to herself.
"Are you going to spoil your life and other
people's with such nonsense?  It is not for you
to say that he is marrying the wrong woman.
She is a hundred times superior to you, and I
suppose he thinks so.  Why is he to be blamed
because he sees no beauty in your little brown
face?  You are nothing to him but Miss Marriott,
the village school-mistress."
</p>

<p>
But that would not do, so she began again,
looking at herself in the glass and crying softly.
"Yes, you are a poor thing, and I pity you, but I
am disappointed in you as well.  You are not a
bit better or more to be trusted than other girls.
You know you are jealous of this Dora Cunningham;
that you hate the very sound of her name,
as though she had not a better right to him than
you.  Has she not known him all her life? and
could she know him without loving him?  Why,"
with a little sob, that sounded very pathetic in
the silence, "as though any one could help it.
Even Emmie loves him, and follows him about
like a dog everywhere.  I am not a bit ashamed
of my affection for him.  I would rather live
lonely, as I shall live, and care about him in the
way I do, receiving little daily kindnesses at his
hand, than marry any other man.  It is not
much of a life perhaps," went on the girl, with a
broken breath or two; "it does not hold as
much as other people's; but such as it is, I
would rather live it than go away elsewhere, and
forget, and perhaps be forgotten."
</p>

<p>
Queenie was preaching a desolate little sermon
to herself, but it edified and comforted her.  It
was only the eddying of the mill-stream when a
stone had been flung into it, she told herself
by-and-bye.  She would be reasonable, and cease
to rebel against an inevitable fate.
</p>

<p>
Garth's evening promised to be more successful.
He had driven himself up to the Vicarage
in the red sunset light that he loved, and Dora
had come out into the porch to welcome him
with her sweetest smile.
</p>

<p>
"How good of you to come! papa and I both
wanted you so," putting up a white little hand
to stroke the mare's glossy coat.  "Poor old
Bess, how hot she looks, and how fast you must
have driven her; you are quite twenty minutes
before the time we expected you."
</p>

<p>
"Have you been looking out for me?  I am
glad I was wanted," returned Garth, leaning
down to take possession of the little hand.  "I
suppose Bess and I were both in a hurry to be
here," he continued, as he looked down with
kindly scrutiny at the dainty figure beside him.
</p>

<p>
Dora was a little paler than usual, and the
blue eyes were a trifle heavy, but somehow her
appearance had never pleased him better.  She
had dressed herself with even greater care than
was customary with her.  The soft cream-colored
dress, with its graceful folds, rested the eye with
a sense of fitness.  One tiny rosebud gave a mere
hint of color.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you wanted me," he went on, with
a little stress on the personal pronoun.  "I must
have been engaged indeed to have remained
away at such a time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed.  Poor papa, and poor dear Flo!"
returned Dora, earnestly, leading him into the
hall.  "How could we help being very anxious
and unhappy, and after Beattie's miserable letter
too?  But that is the worst of girls; they cannot
help exaggerating things."
</p>

<p>
"I was afraid from what you said that poor
Florence is very ill."
</p>

<p>
"She is ill, of course; one is always afraid of
typhoid fever for a growing girl; and then papa
has such a horror of German doctors.  I must
confess myself that I have every faith in Madame
Shleïfer&mdash;such a judicious, temperate letter, and
so different to poor Beattie's, who is crying
herself to sleep every night, and making herself ill."
</p>

<p>
"But Madame Shleïfer does not love Florence
as Beatrix does; she is liable to take alarm less
easily," returned Garth, moved at this picture of
the warm-hearted, impetuous girl he remembered
so well.
</p>

<p>
"Beatrix's affection is not greater than ours,"
replied Dora, calmly.  "Florence is the youngest,
and I have brought her up from such a child.  It
is inconsiderate and a pity to write like that, and
has upset papa dreadfully; but, as I told him, it
was only Beatrix's way.  I am afraid you will
not find us very cheerful company to-night,"
looking up with a certain bright dewiness in her
eyes&mdash;not exactly tears, but a suspicion of them.
</p>

<p>
Dora never cried, as he knew he had once heard
her say that it never mended matters, and only
spoiled the complexion; but as she looked up at
him now with a certain unbending of the lip,
and a shining mist in her blue eyes, he felt
himself touched and softened.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot bear to see you in such trouble," he
said, with involuntary tenderness in his tone.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would be sorry for us," she
returned simply, not moving away from him, but
taking the sympathy as though it belonged to
her of right.  "It was so good of you to come
all this distance just for papa and me."

CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
"IT MUST BE YEA, YEA, OR NAY, NAY, WITH ME."
</h3>

<p class="intro2">
  "Silent she had been, but she raised her face;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'And will you end,' said she, 'this half-told tale?'"<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Jean Ingelow.</i><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Garth felt a little excited as he went up to
the porch-room to dress for dinner; to put on
his war-paint as he told himself with a little
grimace.  Garth was a handsome man, and he
never looked better than when he was in evening
dress.  Though he had less personal vanity than
most men, he was in some measure conscious
of his advantages, and on this occasion he was
a little fastidious as to the set of his collar and
the manipulation of his tie.
</p>

<p>
The porch-room had always been allotted to
him on the rare occasions when he slept at the
vicarage.  The best bed-room was always
apportioned to more formal guests, but Garth much
preferred his old quarters.  The little room with
its pink and white draperies fragrant with
lavender, and its lozenge-paned lattice swinging
open on the roses and clematis, and other
sweet-smelling creepers, always reminded him
of Dora.  There was a portrait of her in
crayons hanging over the mantel-shelf, taken
when she was many years younger, with golden
hair floating round her like a halo, the round
white arms half hidden under a fleecy scarf&mdash;a
charming sketch half idealized, and yet true to
the real Dora.  Garth leant his arms against the
high wooden mantelpiece and contemplated the
drawing for some minutes.
</p>

<p>
"She is prettier than ever to-night," he
soliloquized.  "No one would think she was
seven-and-twenty to look at her this evening.  She is
just the woman never to look her age; she is
so thoroughly healthy in her tone of mind; she
has none of the morbid fancies and over-strained
nerves that make other women so haggard and
worn.  Look at Langley, for example, getting grey
at thirty.  Poor dear Langley! that was a bad
business of hers and Chester's.
</p>

<p>
"And then Dora always dresses so perfectly;
there is a good deal in that, I believe.  Many
pretty women are slovens or absolutely tasteless.
I should hate that in my wife.  I never saw
Dora look otherwise than charming, this evening
especially.  She never wears things that rustle
or fall stiffly, she and Miss Marriott are alike in
that.  By-the-bye, how that girl looked at me
this afternoon as she handed me back Dora's
letter.  There was a sort of pained, beseeching
expression in her eyes that I could not make out,
and which haunts me rather.  I have a notion
that she is not quite so happy as she used to be,
and yet it must be my fancy.  Well, I won't think
about that this evening, I am always questioning
Miss Marriott's looks.  I want to make up my
mind if it would not be as well to say something
to Dora; if things are to be it would be just as
well to feel one's way a little.  I have a notion
this shilly-shallying may lead to some sort of
mischief presently.  I never knew quite how I
stand with her and what is expected of me.  If
a thing is to be done one need not take all one's
life doing it," finished Garth, pulling himself
together with a quick movement as though he
would shake the courage and determination into
him.
</p>

<p>
"Men make their own fate, it is for them to
choose; no one need make mistakes with their
eyes open."  Why did that speech of Queenie's
suddenly recur to him?  "If they make a poor
thing of their own life it is not for them to
complain."  The little protest came to him
almost painfully as the gong sounded, and he
went down-stairs.
</p>

<p>
Dora looked up at him rather curiously from
under her white eyelids as he came into the
room, holding his head high and carrying himself
as though he knew the world was before him.
He returned Mr. Cunningham's affectionate
greeting in a frank, off-hand way.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Garth, you are rather a stranger to the
vicarage; but I am glad to see you here again,
my dear fellow.  How are the sisters? and how
is that young scapegrace of a Ted?"
</p>

<p>
"All well, and I only wish you could say the
same, Mr. Cunningham," began Garth heartily;
but, as the Vicar sighed heavily, Dora shook her
fair head at him.
</p>

<p>
"Poor dear Flo!" she said softly, as though
speaking out her father's thought.  "But papa
must eat his dinner, and then he has some
business on which to consult you, Mr. Clayton;
troubles will always keep, and it is no good papa
spoiling his digestion by dwelling on them, is
it?" finished Dora with tranquil philosophy, and
Garth took the hint.
</p>

<p>
There was no sad talk after that.  The Vicar
still shook his head lugubriously at intervals, but
he did ample justice to the excellent repast before
him, and even brought up some Hermitage with
his own hands for Garth to taste.
</p>

<p>
The young man drank it with a little show of
indifference, more assumed than real.  It was not
that the rarity and flavor of Mr. Cunningham's
wine pleased him, but that the attention shown
him made him a little dizzy.  More than once
some favorite dish for which he had expressed a
predilection had been brought to him.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would like this Mayonnaise.
Mrs. Gilbert has made it exactly to your taste,"
Dora said to him with an engaging smile.
</p>

<p>
Garth, who was only human, and not yet
thirty, felt the delicate flattery thrill through
him like a personal compliment.
</p>

<p>
He was sorry when Dora left the room, and
Mr. Cunningham drew his chair nearer and
plunged into the business that required his
assistance.  With all his good nature and natural
aptitude for these sort of things, he found
it very difficult to lend his undivided attention.
"Why did she prepare that pudding with the
pine-apple sauce with her own hands, because
Mrs. Gilbert would have spoiled it?" he thought,
as he balanced his spoon idly on the edge of his
coffee-cup, thereby imperilling Mr. Cunningham's
favorite Wedgewood.  She had never
condescended to show him such honor before; no
wonder he was dizzy, and turned rather a deaf
ear on the Vicar's tedious explanations.  His
absent, fidgetty demeanor attracted the attention
of his host after a time.
</p>

<p>
"I am keeping you too long with all these
bothering details, you want to be in the next
room," he said, with a meaning smile, over which
the young man blushed hotly.
</p>

<p>
"Not until you have finished with me.  Is
there anything more that I can do in your
absence?" he stammered, feeling a little foolish
and crest-fallen.
</p>

<p>
"No, no; Beale can do the rest.  Get along
with you, and tell Dora to let me know when tea
is ready," and the Vicar flung his cambric
handkerchief over his white head and composed
himself for a nap.
</p>

<p>
Garth had not quite got rid of his flush when
he opened the drawing-room door.  Mr. Cunningham's
smile had rather daunted him, but Dora
gave him a bright little glance as he entered.
</p>

<p>
"How long you and papa have been over your
stupid business!  I am so tired of being alone,"
she said, welcoming the truant with a fascinating
attempt at a pout.
</p>

<p>
The shaded lamps had been lighted in the
Vicarage drawing-room; there was a burnished
gleam of silver and china on the little square
tea-table.  A wood fire had been kindled on the
hearth, but the windows and the glass door of
the conservatory were open.  Dora sat in her
low carved chair with her lap full of silks and
crewels.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to get away.  I think your father
saw that at last, for he set me free.  I am afraid
he thought me very inattentive," replied Garth,
taking up his favorite position against the mantel-piece.
</p>

<p>
He was still a little flushed, more from that
smile than the Hermitage, and his eyes had a
quick excited gleam in them.  Dora understood
it all perfectly, but she was quite mistress of the
situation.  Woman-like, she felt a little triumph
in the exercise of her power.
</p>

<p>
"If I were to yield another hair's-breadth there
is no telling what the foolish fellow would do,"
she thought, not without a quickening of the
pulse under those intent looks.  The danger had
a subtle sweetness even for her, though she was
too self-controlled to be swayed by it.
</p>

<p>
"Do sit down; you are so tall that it quite
makes me ache to look up at you," she said, with
that pretty attempt at a pout; "and then I want
to speak to you seriously."
</p>

<p>
Garth might be pardoned if he took that
petulant command as an invitation to draw his
chair rather closely.  But though Dora saw her
mistake she went on calmly, quite ignoring the
near neighborhood of the infatuated young
man.
</p>

<p>
"When one sees a thing clearly it is always
best to speak of it," began Dora, busily sorting
her crewels, and making believe not to notice that
Garth had his elbow on the back of her chair.
"Langley is too lenient, and then Miss Cosie is
not one for lecturing; but still some one ought
to speak."
</p>

<p>
"On what subject?" demanded Garth absently.
He was wondering how he ought to
begin.
</p>

<p>
"Why, on the subject of Miss Marriott's dress,
of course," returned Dora briskly and with
emphasis.  "If no one will speak, neither Langley
nor Miss Cosie, and then Cathy is such a child,
it seems to me as though I ought not to keep
silence."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Marriott's dress!" interrupted Garth
in an astonished voice.  "Why, Dora, what can
you be meaning?  The subject has nothing to
do with us&mdash;with you and me&mdash;at all."
</p>

<p>
"Every subject has to do with me that touches
on questions of right and wrong," she returned
with dignity.  "I consider Miss Marriott's
general style of dress and appearance is perfectly
unsuitable to a village school-mistress, and sets
the worst possible example to the grown-up girls
in Hepshaw."
</p>

<p>
"This is perfectly incomprehensible," he
replied, secretly exasperated by the turn the
conversation was taking, and rather resenting this
undeserved attack on his <i>protégée</i>.  "Langley
and I are always praising Miss Marriott's quiet,
unobtrusive style."
</p>

<p>
"One knows what to expect of a gentleman
when there is a pretty face in question," retorted
Dora, with a touch of scorn in her voice.  "Not
that I call Miss Marriott pretty.  She has such
singular eyes, and then I never admire a brown
skin.  But I must own I thought better things
of Langley."
</p>

<p>
"I am completely at sea," returned Garth,
lifting his eyebrows in comical perplexity.
</p>

<p>
That little speech of Dora's about Miss Marriott's
eyes and brown skin amused him.  Could
she be jealous of the young stranger he had taken
under his brotherly protection?  Garth's elbow
rested still more comfortably on the back of her
chair as this little bit of self-flattery intruded
itself.
</p>

<p>
"I always see Miss Marriott in a plain black
stuff gown, with just a bit of white lace or frilling
round her throat.  I don't see how any one could
dress more plainly."
</p>

<p>
"That shows how much you men notice
things," returned Dora still more scornfully, and
somewhat irate at his incredulity.  Garth was
never very easy to convince, "Black stuff! a
fine cashmere, that cost four shillings a yard if
it cost a penny, and looking as if it were made
by the most finished dress-maker in Carlisle,
and a Leghorn hat trimmed with an ostrich
feather."
</p>

<p>
Garth looked a little sheepish at this.  The
feather had certainly non-plussed him.  It was
quite true that during the last few Sundays Miss
Marriott had appeared in church in a shady hat
with a long drooping feather that had suited her
remarkably well.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot deny the feather," he rejoined, with
a rueful smile at his defeat.
</p>

<p>
The admission mollified Dora.
</p>

<p>
"And then her boots and gloves&mdash;best Paris
kid, and boots that look certainly as though they
were from a French maker.  Ah, you cannot
deceive me!  Do you think such a fine lady is
likely to benefit the village girls?  Why, if Miss
Stapleton were to mount a feather like that papa
and I would be down upon her at once."
</p>

<p>
"I should not compare Miss Marriott and Miss
Stapleton," a little testily.  "Miss Marriott is
better born and educated.  She is a country
vicar's daughter.  I am sure that you cannot
deny that she is a perfect gentlewoman."
</p>

<p>
"I do not deny that she is a very pleasant-mannered,
well-looking young woman," returned
Dora, in an aggravating manner, crossing her
plump hands on her lap and looking up at Garth
serenely.  "I take a great interest in Miss
Marriott, not only for her own sake, but because she
is yours and Langley's <i>protégée</i>.  When one sees
a thing is wrong it is a duty to speak, and I
hope I shall always do my duty," finished Dora,
virtuously.
</p>

<p>
Garth was silent.  He was quite used to these
sort of lectures from the young mistress of
Crossgill Vicarage.  It had long been an admitted
fact between them that her mission extended to
Hepshaw.  The village school-mistresses had
been perpetual thorns in her side; their dress
and demeanor, their teaching and morals, had
always been carefully investigated.  The last
Hepshaw mistress had been a weak, pale-eyed
creature, with no will of her own, and no
particular views,&mdash;a washed-out piece of humanity,
as Garth termed her,&mdash;but highly esteemed and
lamented by Miss Cunningham.
</p>

<p>
Garth could not forbear a smile of secret
amusement at Dora's persevering efforts to draw
Miss Marriott under her yoke.  The contest
between the two interested and provoked him.
He had taken upon himself to lecture Queenie
on her stiff-necked demeanor towards Miss
Cunningham, and now he was ready to take up
cudgels in her defence.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are a little hard upon her," he
began at last slowly, and then he stopped.
</p>

<p>
Why should he concern himself with things so
wholly feminine? most likely Dora was right, at
least he had never found her wrong in anything
yet.  Perhaps that drooping hat and feather might
be a snare to the female population of Hepshaw.
It had startled even him as she had walked up
the aisle that Sunday.  Let them fight it out;
he was not sitting there in that lamp-lit fragrant
drawing-room to talk about Miss Marriott.  He
was Dora's guest, summoned there by her own
will and behest.  Mr. Cunningham did not often
leave them alone like this, the opportunity was
too precious to be wasted.
</p>

<p>
Garth moved a little restlessly as he pondered
thus with his arm against Dora's chair.  The
shapely head was very close to him.  For the
first time he felt an irresistible impulse to touch
the smooth coil of fair hair with his hand, it
looked as fine and silky as a child's.
</p>

<p>
"Dora," he began, and then again he stopped.
"Dora," and this time he came a little closer,
almost leaning over her, but not touching her,
"shall things be different between you and me?"
</p>

<p>
He had taken her by surprise, and for an
instant she turned pale, but she recovered herself
immediately.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clayton," she returned, carefully avoiding
his eyes, and sorting her crewels industriously,
"I thought I had broken you of that foolish
habit of calling me Dora."
</p>

<p>
Garth drew back, stung by her tone.
</p>

<p>
"What does that mean?" he inquired hotly.
"If I am not to call you Dora how are things to
be put straight between us?  I thought we
understood each other, and that the time had come for
me to speak.  What does this mean?" continued
the fiery young man, twisting his moustache in
sudden excitement and wrath.
</p>

<p>
"Did you think to-night was a fitting opportunity,"
inquired Dora with mournful gentleness,
"with poor darling Flo, and papa in such a state?
How could you be so inconsiderate and selfish,"
looking at him with appealing blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
But Garth's feelings had been outraged, and
no soft looks could mollify him.  He was a
well-meaning, plain-spoken young fellow, and he had
brought himself with much searching of
conscience to the brink of an honest resolution.
Dora's coldness of rebuke had wounded his
susceptibility and grazed his pride.  No woman
should trifle with his affections, so he told
himself, and least of all his old friend Dora.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure you did not mean to be inconsiderate,"
she said, looking up at him with a
beseeching glance.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know what you call want of
consideration," returned Garth, with one of his rare
frowns.  "I should have thought if you cared
for me that trouble would have drawn us closer
together, that this was the time of all others to
speak."
</p>

<p>
"If I cared for you!" with reproachful sweetness.
"Oh, Mr. Clayton, how can you say such
harsh things? and to me of all persons in the
world!  Is it my fault that darling Flo is ill, and
that Beattie is so young and such a wretched
manager that one dares not trust things to her
for a long time yet?  Can I help not being my
own mistress like other women, and having so
many responsibilities&mdash;poor papa, and the girls,
and the school, and hundreds of things?" she
finished with a little pathos.
</p>

<p>
But Garth was not to be so easily appeased.
His strong will was roused by opposition, and
Dora must learn that he was not a man to be
trifled with.  A moment before he had felt a
longing to press his lips to that smooth, golden
coil, but now all such desire had left him.
</p>

<p>
"This is all nonsense," he returned, almost
harshly.  "We have known each other all our
lives, and this has been understood between us.
There are no insuperable obstacles&mdash;none, or I
would not have spoken.  Beatrix is seventeen,
and she must learn to manage as other girls do.
If you mean to sacrifice your life for a mistaken
sense of duty you have no right to spoil mine
with all this waiting.  I am not to call you
Dora; I am not to be any more to you than I
have been.  What does all this folly mean,"
finished Garth, with angry excitement.
</p>

<p>
"It means that things cannot be different just
now," replied Dora, with real tremulousness in
her voice, and now again there came that soft
mistiness in her eyes.  She was not offended at
her lover's plain speaking; she liked Garth all
the better for that manly outburst of independence.
He was a little more difficult to manage
than she had thought, but she was in no fear of
ultimate results; he was straining at his curb,
that was all.
</p>

<p>
"You must not be angry with me because I
am disappointing you," she went on, laying her
hand upon his coat-sleeve.  "It is not my fault
that everything depends on me, and that Beattie
is so helpless.  Of course if one could do as one
wished&mdash;" and here there was a swift downward
glance, but Garth broke in upon her impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"All this is worse than nothing," observed the
exasperated young man.  "It must be yea, yea,
or nay, nay, with me; this going backwards and
forwards and holding one's faith in a leash
would never do for me.  How could a man
answer for himself under such circumstances?  If
you send me away from you you will find it
very hard to recall me, Dora!" with a sudden
change of voice, at once injured and affectionate,
and which went far to mollify the effect of his
former harshness.
</p>

<p>
"You will always know I cared, and that one
could not do as one wished.  If we are Christians
we know that duty cannot be shirked," began
Dora with beautiful solemnity, and a certain
brightness of earnestness in her blue eyes; but
at that moment her father entered.
</p>

<p>
"Papa," she said, as Garth rose hastily, almost
shaking off her hand in his excitement, "what
a long nap you have been taking!  Mr. Clayton
and I have been talking for ever so long, and the
tea is quite cold."
</p>

<p>
"I hope not, Dorrie," observed Mr. Cunningham,
seating himself comfortably in his elbow-chair
and warming his white hand over the
blaze.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but it is perfectly lukewarm," returned
his daughter cheerfully, as she walked to the
tea-table and poured out the soothing beverage.
She was quite tranquil as she sat there under the
shaded lamps.  The danger had been met and
encountered, but she had remained mistress of
the situation.  It was natural for him to feel a
little downcast and aggrieved over his defeat.
Men were such creatures of impulse.
</p>

<p>
"He is angry with me now, but he will come
round by-and-bye," thought Dora, watching
him with affectionate solicitude.  In her breast
she was very fond and proud of him, though the
young mistress of Crossgill was not ready to lay
down her prerogative and rights at his behests.
"I am not afraid of his taking the bit between
his teeth," she said to herself, with a smile of
incredulity at the bare idea.  How was Garth
Clayton, her old friend and playmate, to prove
unfaithful to her?
</p>

<p>
As for Garth, he conducted himself as most
high-spirited young men do under the
circumstances.  He took his cup of cold tea from her
hand mutely, much as though it were a dose of
poison, and stood aloof, glowering at her at
intervals, and talking faster than usual to
Mr. Cunningham.
</p>

<p>
He did not make much of a reply when, after
prayers, Dora lighted his silver candlestick as
well as her father's, and hoped he would sleep
well.
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Dorrie my dear," observed her
father, kissing her smooth forehead just above
her eyes.  "Don't forget you have a long journey
before you to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Miss Cunningham," said Garth
with pointed emphasis as he just touched her
hand.
</p>

<p>
He thought the coldness of his tone would
have cut her to the heart, but she merely smiled
in his face.
</p>

<p>
Garth went up-stairs in a tumult of vexation
and excitement.  The porch-chamber, with its
sweet perfume of fresh lavender, no longer
charmed him.  The girlish reflection of Dora
with its arms full of lilies angered him.  He
turned his back upon it and sat down by the
open window.
</p>

<p>
He was bitterly mortified and disappointed.
Dora had been his fate, he told himself, and now
his fate had eluded him.  She had drawn him on
with sweet looks and half-sentences of fondness
all these years, and now she had declined to yield
to his first honest efforts of persuasion.  Well,
he was not the man to be fooled by any girl,
though she had golden hair and knew how to use
her eyes.  She was managing him for her own
purposes, but he would prove to her that he was
not to be managed.  He would shake off her
influence much as he had done her hand on his
coat-sleeve just now; all the more that such
shaking off might be difficult to him.  There
were other women in the world, thank heaven,
beside Dora&mdash;women who would be more
subservient to his masculine royalty, whose wills
and lives could be moulded by his.
</p>

<p>
His heart was still whole within him, though
his pride was so grievously wounded.  He knew
that, as he turned his back upon her picture, and
sat down in his sullen resentment.  There was
no inward bleeding, no sickness of repressed
hopes driven back upon themselves, no yearning
void, only the bitterness of an angry wound,
against which he called out in his young man's
impatience.  The golden head would not come
and nestle against him when he longed for it,
and now he thrust it from him.
</p>

<p>
As for Dora, she went up to her room in
perfect tranquillity.  "Foolish fellow, how angry
he was with me," she said to herself as she
brushed out the long fair hair that fell round her
in a halo.  Her blue eyes looked through it like
Undine's.  "I wonder if all lovers would be so
troublesome; it wanted all one's tact to keep him
within bounds.  I wish Flo were not so young,
and that Beattie were less helpless," she went on,
with a sigh.  "It will be hard work keeping him
in good humor the next year or two, but it would
never do to engage myself to him as things are
now.  I have enough on my hands without
that," and with another involuntary sigh, as she
thought of Garth's handsome countenance, Dora
Cunningham, like a right-minded young woman,
put away the subject from her mind and went to
sleep.
